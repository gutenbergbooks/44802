PRELIMINARY DISCOURSE.
</h2>

rest of her sex, requires because she requires, that before a writer
begins the business of his book, he should give an account to the world of
his reasons for producing it; and therefore, to avoid singularity, we
shall proceed with the statement of our own, excepting only a few private
ones, which are neither here nor there.
</p>
<p>
To advance the interests of mankind by promoting the cause of Education;
to ameliorate the conversation of the masses; to cultivate Taste, and
diffuse Refinement; these are the objects we have in view in submitting a
Comic English Grammar to the patronage of a discerning Public.
</p>
<p>
Few persons there are, whose ears are so extremely obtuse, as not to be
frequently annoyed at the violations of Grammar by which they are so often
assailed. It is really painful to be forced, in walking along the streets,
to hear such phrases as, "That 'ere omnibus."
</p>
<p>
"Where've you bin?"
</p>
<p>
"Vot's the odds?" and the like. Very dreadful expressions are also used by
cartmen and others in addressing their horses. What can possibly induce a
human being to say "Gee woot!"
</p>
<p>
"'Mather way!" or "Woa not to mention the atrocious "Kim aup!" of the
barbarous butcher's boy.
</p>
<p>
It is notorious that the above and greater enormities are perpetrated in
spite of the number of Grammars already before the world. This fact
sufficiently excuses the present addition to the stock; and as serious
English Grammars have hitherto failed to effect the desired reformation,
we are induced to attempt it by means of a Comic one.
</p>
<p>
With regard to the moral tendency of our labors, we may be here permitted
to remark, that they will tend, if successful, to the suppression of <i>evil
speaking </i>; and as the Spartans used to exhibit a tipsy slave to their
children with a view to disgust them with drunkenness, so we, by giving a
few examples here and there, of incorrect phraseology, shall expose, in
their naked deformity, the vices of speech to the ingenious reader.
</p>
<p>
The <span class="pagenum"><a name="link004" id="link004"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p004.jpg">004</a></span>comical mind, like the
jaundiced eye, views everything through a colored medium. Such a mind is
that of the generality of our countrymen. We distinguish even the nearest
ties of relationship by facetious names. A father is called "dad," or
"poppa;" an uncle, "nunkey and a wife, a "rib," or more pleasantly still,
as in the advertisements for situations, "an encumbrance."
</p>
<p>
We will not allow a man to give an old woman a dose of rhubarb if he have
not acquired at least half a dozen sciences; but we permit a quack to sell
as much poison as he pleases. When one man runs away with another's wife,
and, being on that account challenged to fight a duel, shoots the
aggrieved party through the head, the latter is said to receive <i>satisfaction</i>.
</p>
<p>
We never take a glass of wine at dinner without getting somebody else to
do the same, as if we wanted encouragement; and then, before we venture to
drink, we bow to each other across the table, preserving all the while a
most wonderful gravity. This, however, it may be said, is the natural
result of endeavoring to keep one another in countenance.
</p>
<p>
The way in which we imitate foreign manners and customs is very amusing.
Savages stick fish-bones through their noses; our fair countrywomen have
hoops of metal poked through their ears. The Caribs flatten the forehead;
the Chinese compress the foot; and we possess similar contrivances for
reducing the figure of a young lady to a resemblance to an hour-glass or a
devil-on-two-sticks.
</p>
<p>
There being no other assignable motive for these and the like proceedings,
it is reasonable to suppose that they are adopted, as schoolboys say, "for
fun."
</p>
<p>
We could go on, were it necessary, adducing facts to an almost unlimited
extent; but we consider that enough has now been said in proof of the
comic character of the national mind. And in conclusion, if any other than
an English or American author can be produced, equal in point of wit,
humor, and drollery, to Swift, Sterne, Dickens, or Paulding, we hereby
engage to eat him; albeit we have no pretensions to the character of a
"helluo librorum."
</p>
<p>
"English <span class="pagenum"><a name="link005" id="link005"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p005.jpg">005</a></span>Grammar," according to
Lindley Murray, "is the art of speaking and writing the English language
with propriety."
</p>
<p>
The English language, written and spoken with propriety, is commonly
called the King's English.
</p>
<p>
A monarch, who, three or four generations back, occupied the English
throne, is reported to have said, "If beebles will be boets, they must
sdarve." This was a rather curious specimen of "King's English." It is,
however, a maxim of English law, that "the King can do no wrong." Whatever
bad English, therefore, may proceed from the royal mouth, is not "King's
English," but "Minister's English," for which they alone-are responsible.
</p>
<p>
King's English (or perhaps, under existing circumstances it should be
called, <i>Queen's</i> English) is the current coin of conversation, to
mutilate which, and unlawfully to <i>utter</i> the same, is called <i>clipping</i>
the King's English; a high crime and misdemeanor. Clipped English, or bad
English, is one variety of Comic <span class="pagenum"><a name="link006"
id="link006"></a><a href="../44802-page-images/p006.jpg">006</a></span>English,
of which we shall adduce instances hereafter.
</p>
<p>
Slipslop, or the erroneous substitution of one word for another, as
"prodigy" for "protegee," "derangement" for "arrangement," "exasperate"
for "aspirate," and the like, is another.

<p>
Slang, which consists in cant words and phrases, as "dodge" for "sly
trick," "no go" for "failure," and "camey" "to flatter," may be considered
a third.
</p>
<p>
Latinised English, or Fine English, sometimes assumes the character of
Comic English, especially when applied to the purposes of common
discourse; as <span class="pagenum"><a name="link007" id="link007"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p007.jpg">007</a></span>"Extinguish the
luminary," "Agitate the coramunicator," "Are your corporeal functions in a
condition of salubrity?" "A sable visual orb," "A sanguinary nasal
protuberance."
</p>
<p>
American English is Comic English in a "<i>pretty particular considerable
tarnation</i>" degree.
</p>
<p>
English Grammar is divided into four parts-Orthography, Etymology, Syntax,
and Prosody; and as these are points that a good grammarian always stands
upon, he, particularly when a pedant, and consequently somewhat <i>flat</i>,
may very properly be compared to a table.

<p>
Now, to proceed with Orthography, we may remark, that a letter is the
least part of a word.
</p>
<p>
Of a <i>comic letter</i> an instance has already been given. Dr. Johnson's
letter to Lord Chesterfield is a capital letter.
</p>
<p>
The letters of the Alphabet are the representatives of articulate sounds.
</p>
<p>
The Alphabet is a Republic of Letters.
</p>
<p>
There <span class="pagenum"><a name="link010" id="link010"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p010.jpg">010</a></span>are many things in this
world erroneously as well as vulgarly compared to "bricks." In the case of
the letters of the Alphabet, however, the comparison is just; they
constitute the fabric of a language, and grammar is the mortar. The wonder
is that there should be so few of them. The English letters are twenty-six
in number. There is nothing like beginning at the beginning; and we shall
now therefore enumerate them, with the view also of rendering their
insertion subsidiary to mythological instruction, in conformity with the
plan on which some account of the Heathen Deities and ancient heroes is
prefixed or subjoined to a Dictionary. We present the reader with a form
of Alphabet composed in humble imitation of that famous one, which, while
appreciable by the dullest taste, and level to the meanest capacity, is
nevertheless that by which the greatest minds have been agreeably inducted
into knowledge.
</p>
<h3>
THE ALPHABET.
</h3>
<p>
A, was Apollo, the god of the carol,
</p>
<p>
B, stood for Bacchus, astride on his barrel;
</p>
<p>
C, for good Ceres, the goddess of grist,
</p>
<p>
D, was Diana, that wouldn't be kiss'd;
</p>
<p>
E, was nymph Echo, that pined to a sound,
</p>
<p>
F, was sweet Flora, with buttercups crown'd;
</p>
<p>
G, was Jove's pot-boy, young Ganymede hight,
</p>
<p>
H, was fair Hebe, his barmaid so tight;
</p>
<p>
I, little Io, turn'd into a cow,
</p>
<p>
J, jealous Juno, that spiteful old sow;
</p>
<p>
K, was Kitty, more lovely than goddess or muse;
</p>
<p>
L, Lacooon&mdash;I wouldn't have been in <i>his</i> shoes! <span
class="pagenum"><a name="link011" id="link011"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p011.jpg">011</a></span>
</p>
<p>
M, was blue-eyed Minerva, with stockings to match,
</p>
<p>
N, was Nestor, with grey beard and silvery thatch;
</p>
<p>
O, was lofty Olympus, King Jupiter's shop,
</p>
<p>
P, Parnassus, Apollo hung out on its top;
</p>
<p>
Q, stood for Quirites, the Romans, to wit;
</p>
<p>
R, for rantipole Roscius, that made such a hit;
</p>
<p>
S, for Sappho, so famous for felo-de-se,
</p>
<p>
T, for Thales the wise, F. R. S. and M. D:
</p>
<p>
U, was crafty Ulysses, so artful a dodger,
</p>
<p>
V, was hop-a-kick Vulcan, that limping old codger;
</p>
<p>
Wenus-Venus I mean-with a W begins,
</p>
<p>
(Veil, if I ham a Cockney, wot need of your grins?)
</p>
<p>
X, was Xantippe, the scratch-cat and shrew,
</p>
<p>
Y, I don't know what Y was, whack me if I do!
</p>
<p>
Z was Zeno the Stoic, Zenobia the clever,
</p>
<p>
And Zoilus the critic, whose fame lasts forever.
</p>
<p>
Letters are divided into Vowels and Consonants.
</p>
<p>
The vowels are capable of being perfectly uttered by themselves. They are,
as it were, independent members of the Alphabet, and like independent
members elsewhere, form a small minority. The vowels are <i>a, e, i, o, u</i>,
and sometimes <i>w</i> and <i>y</i>.
</p>
<p>
An I. O. U. is a more pleasant thing to have, than it is to give.
</p>
<p>
A blow in the stomach is very likely to W up.
</p>
<p>
W is a consonant when it begins a word, as "Wicked
</p>
<p>
Will Wiggins whacked his wife with a whip but in every other place it is a
vowel, as crawling, drawling, sawney, screwing, Jew. Y follows the same
rule.
</p>
<p>
A consonant is an articulate sound; but, like an old bachelor, if it
exists alone, it exists to no purpose.
</p>
<p>

<p>
It <span class="pagenum"><a name="link012" id="link012"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p012.jpg">012</a></span>cannot be perfectly
uttered without the aid of a vowel; and even then the vowel has the
greatest share in the production of the sound. Thus a vowel joined to a
consonant becomes, so to speak, a "better half:" or at all events very
strongly resembles one.
</p>
<p>
A dipthong is the union of two vowels in one sound, as ea in heavy, eu in
Meux, ou in stout.
</p>
<p>
A tripthong is a similar union of three vowels, as <i>eau</i> in the word
beau; a term applied to dandies, and addressed to geese: probably because
they are birds of a feather.
</p>
<p>
A proper dipthong is that in which the sound is formed by both the vowels:
as, aw in awkward, ou in lout.

An <span class="pagenum"><a name="link013" id="link013"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p013.jpg">013</a></span>improper dipthong is
that in which the sound is formed by one of the vowels only, as ea in
heartless, oa in hoax.
</p>
<p>
According to our notions there are a great many improper dipthongs in
common use. By improper dipthongs we mean vowels unwarrantably dilated
into dipthongs, and dipthongs mispronounced, in defiance of good English.
</p>
<p>
For instance, the rustics and dandies say,
</p>
<p>
"Loor! whaut a foine gaal! Moy oy!"
</p>
<p>
"Whaut a precious soight of crows!"
</p>
<p>
"As I was a cornin' whoam through the corn fiddles (fields) I met Willum
Jones."
</p>
<p>
"I sor (saw) him."
</p>
<p>
"Dror (draw) it out."
</p>
<p>
"Hold your jor (jaw)."
</p>
<p>
"I caun't. You shaun't. How's your Maw and Paw? Do you like taut (tart)?"
</p>
<p>
We have heard young ladies remark,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Oh, my! What a naice young man!"
</p>
<p>
"What a bee&mdash;eautiful day!"
</p>
<p>
"Im so fond of dayncing!"
</p>
<p>
Again, dandies frequently exclaim,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"I'm postively tiawed (tired)."
</p>
<p>
"What a sweet tempaw! (temper)."
</p>
<p>
"How daughty (dirty) the streets au!"
</p>
<p>
And they also call,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
Literature, "literetchah."
</p>
<p>
Perfectly, "pawfacly."
</p>
<p>
Disgusted, "disgasted."
</p>
<p>
Sky, "ske&mdash;eye."
</p>
<p>
Blue, "ble&mdash;ew."
</p>
<p>
We might here insert a few remarks on the nature of <span class="pagenum"><a
name="link014" id="link014"></a><a href="../44802-page-images/p014.jpg">014</a></span>the
human voice, and of the mechanism by means of which articulation is
performed; but besides our dislike to prolixity, we are afraid of getting
<i>down in the mouth</i>, and thereby going the <i>wrong way</i> to please
our readers. We may nevertheless venture to invite attention to a few
comical peculiarities in connection with articulate sounds.
</p>
<p>
Ahem! at the commencement of a speech, is a sound agreeably droll.
</p>
<p>
The vocal comicalities of the infant in arms are exceedingly laughable,
but we are unfortunately unable to spell them.
</p>
<p>
The articulation of the Jew is peculiarly ridiculous. The "peoplesh" are
badly spoken of, and not well spoken.
</p>
<p>
Bawling, croaking, hissing, whistling, and grunting, are elegant vocal
accomplishments.
</p>
<p>
Lisping, as, thweet, Dthooliur, thawming, kweechau, is by some considered
interesting, by others absurd.
</p>
<p>
But of all the sounds which proceed from the human mouth, by far the
funniest are Ha! ha! ha!&mdash;Ho! ho! ho! and He! he! he!

CHAPTER II. OF SYLLABLES.
</h2>
<h3>
Syllable <span class="pagenum"><a name="link015" id="link015"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p015.jpg">015</a></span>is a nice word, it
sounds so much like syllabub!
</h3>
<p>
A syllable, whether it constitute a word or part of a word, is a sound,
either simple or compound, produced by one effort of the voice, as, "O!
what, a lark!&mdash;Here, we, are!"
</p>
<p>
Spelling is the art of putting together the letters which compose a
syllable, or the syllables which compose a word.

Comic spelling is usually the work of imagination.
</p>
<p>
The <span class="pagenum"><a name="link016" id="link016"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p016.jpg">016</a></span>chief rule to be
observed in this kind of spelling, is, to spell every word as it is
pronounced; though the rule is not universally observed by comic spellers.
The following example, for the genuineness of which we can vouch, is one
so singularly apposite, that although we have already submitted a similar
specimen of orthography to the reader, we are irresistibly tempted to make
a second experiment on his indulgence. The epistolary curiosity, then,
which we shall now proceed to transcribe, was addressed by a patient to
his medical adviser.
</p>

<p>
Among the various kinds of spelling may be enumerated spelling for a
favor; or giving what is called a broad hint.
</p>
<p>
Certain rules for the division of words into syllables are laid down in
some grammars, and we should be very glad to follow the established usage,
but limited as we are by considerations of comicality and space, we <span
class="pagenum"><a name="link017" id="link017"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p017.jpg">017</a></span>cannot afford to give
more than two very general directions. If you do not know how to spell a
word, look it out in the dictionary, and if you have no dictionary by you,
write the word in such a way, that, while it may be guessed at, it shall
not be legible.

<h2>
CHAPTER III. OF WORDS IN GENERAL.
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>here is no one question that we are aware of more puzzling than this,
"What is your opinion of <i>things</i> in general?" <i>Words</i> in
general are, fortunately for us, a subject on which the formation of an
opinion is somewhat more easy. Words stand for things: they are a sort of
counters, checks, bank-notes, and sometimes, indeed, they are <i>notes</i>
for which people get a great deal of money. Such words, however, are,
alas! not generally English words, but Italian. Strange! that so much
should be given for a mere song. It is quite clear that the givers,
whatever may be their pretensions to a refined or literary taste, must be
entirely unacquainted with <i>Words</i>worth.
</p>
<p>
Fine words are oily enough, and he who uses them is vulgarly said to "cut
it fat;" but for all that it is well known that they will not butter
parsnips.
</p>
<p>
Some say that words are but wind: for this reason, when people are having
words, it is often said, that "the wind's up."
</p>
<p>
Different <span class="pagenum"><a name="link018" id="link018"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p018.jpg">018</a></span>words please different
people. Philosophers are fond of hard words; pedants of tough words, long
words, and crackjaw words; bullies, of rough words; boasters, of big
words; the rising generation, of slang words; fashionable people, of
French words; wits, of sharp words and smart words; and ladies, of nice
words, sweet words, soft words, and soothing words; and, indeed, of words
in general.
</p>
<p>
Words (when spoken) are articulate sounds used by common consent as signs
of our ideas.
</p>
<p>
A word of one syllable is called a Monosyllable: as, you, are, a, great,
oaf.
</p>
<p>
A word of two syllables is named a Dissyllable; as, cat-gut, mu-sic.
</p>
<p>
A word of three syllables is termed a Trisyllable; as, Mag-net-ism,
Mum-mer-y.
</p>
<p>
A word of four or more syllables is entitled a Polysyllable; as,
in-ter-mi-na-ble cir-cum-lo-cu-ti-on, ex-as-pe-ra-ted, func-ti-o-na-ry,
met-ro-po-li-tan, ro-tun-di-ty.
</p>
<p>
Words of more syllables than one are sometimes comically contracted into
one syllable; as, in s'pose for suppose, b'lieve for believe, and 'scuse
for excuse: here, perhaps, 'buss, abbreviated from omnibus, deserves to be
mentioned.
</p>
<p>
In like manner, many long words are elegantly trimmed and shortened; as,
ornary for ordinary, 'strornary for extraordinary, and curosity for
curiosity; to which mysterus for mysterious may also be added.
</p>
<p>
Polysyllables are an essential element in the sublime, both in poetry and
in prose; but especially in that <span class="pagenum"><a name="link019"
id="link019"></a><a href="../44802-page-images/p019.jpg">019</a></span>species
of the sublime which borders very closely on the ridiculous; as,
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">

<p>
All words are either primitive or derivative. A primitive word is that
which cannot be reduced to any simpler word in the language; as, brass,
York, knave. A derivative word, under the head of which compound words are
also included, is that which may be reduced to another and a more simple
word in the English language; as, brazen, Yorkshire, knavery, mud-lark,
lighterman. Broadbrim is a derivative word; but it is one often applied to
a very <i>primitive</i> kind of person.

CHAPTER I. A COMICAL VIEW OF THE PARTS OF SPEECH.
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">E</span>tymology <span class="pagenum"><a name="link020" id="link020"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p020.jpg">020</a></span>teaches the varieties,
modifications, and derivation of words.
</p>
<p>
The derivation of words means that which they come from <i>as words</i>;
for what they come from <i>as sounds</i>, is another matter. Some words
come from the heart, and then they are pathetic; others from the nose, in
which case they are ludicrous. The funniest place, however, from which
words can come is the stomach. By the way, the Mayor would do well to keep
a ventriloquist, from whom, at a moment's notice, he might ascertain the
voice of the corporation.
</p>
<p>
Comic Etymology teaches us the varieties, modifications, and derivation,
of words invested with a comic character.
</p>
<p>
Grammatically speaking, we say that there are, in English, as many sorts
of words as a cat is said to have lives, nine; namely, the Article, the
Substantive or Noun, the Adjective, the Pronoun, the Verb, the Adverb, the
Preposition, the Conjunction, and the Interjection.
</p>
<p>
Comically speaking, there are a great many sorts of words which we have
not room enough to particularise j individually. We can therefore only
afford to classify them. For instance; there are words which are spoken in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="link021" id="link021"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p021.jpg">021</a></span>the <i>Low Countries</i>,
and are <i>High Dutch</i> to persons of quality.
</p>
<p>
Words in use amongst all those who have to do with horses.
</p>
<p>
Words that pass between rival cab-men.
</p>
<p>
Words spoken in a state of intoxication.
</p>
<p>
Words uttered under excitement.
</p>
<p>
Words of endearment, addressed by parents to children in arms.
</p>
<p>
Similar words, sometimes called burning, tender, soft, and broken words,
addressed to young ladies, and whispered, lisped, sighed, or drawled,
according to circumstances.
</p>
<p>
Words of honor; as, tailors' words and shoemakers' words; which, like the
above-mentioned, or lovers' words, are very often broken.
</p>
<p>
With many other sorts of words, which will be readily suggested by the
reader's fancy.
</p>
<p>
But now let us go on with the parts of speech.
</p>
<p>
1. An Article is a word prefixed to substantives to point them out, and to
show the extent of their meaning; as, <i>a</i> dandy, <i>an</i> ape, <i>the</i>
simpleton.
</p>
<p>
One kind of comic article is otherwise denominated an oddity, or queer
article.
</p>
<p>
Another kind of comic article is often to be met with in some of our
monthly magazines.
</p>
<p>
2. A Substantive or Noun is the name of anything that exists, or of which
we have any notion; as, <i>tinker, tailor, soldier, sailor, apothecary,
ploughboy, thief.</i>
</p>
<p>
Now the above definition of a substantive is Lindley Murray's, not ours.
We mention this, because we have an objection, though, not, perhaps, a
serious one, to <span class="pagenum"><a name="link022" id="link022"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p022.jpg">022</a></span>urge against it; for,
in the first place, we have "no notion" of impudence, and yet impudence is
a substantive; and, in the second, we invite attention to the following
piece of Logic,
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
A substantive is something,
But nothing is a substantive;
Therefore, nothing is something.
</pre>
<p>
A substantive may generally be known by its taking an article before it,
and by its making sense of itself; as, a <i>treat</i>, the <i>mulligrubs</i>,
an <i>ache</i>.
</p>
<p>
3. An Adjective is a word joined to a substantive to denote its quality;
as a <i>ragged</i> regiment, an <i>odd</i> set.
</p>
<p>
You may distinguish an adjective by its making sense with the word thing:
as, a <i>poor</i> thing, a <i>sweet</i> thing, a <i>cool</i> thing; or
with any particular substantive, as a <i>ticklish</i> position, an <i>awkward</i>
mistake, a <i>strange</i> step.
</p>
<p>
4. A Pronoun is a word used in lieu of a noun, in order to avoid
tautology: as, "The man wants calves; <i>he</i> is a lath; <i>he</i> is a
walking-stick.''
</p>
<p>
5. A Verb is a word which signifies to be, to do, or to suffer: as, I am;
I calculate; I am fixed.
</p>
<p>
A verb may usually be distinguished by its making sense with a personal
pronoun, or with the word to before it: as I yell, he grins, they caper;
or to drink, to smoke, to chew.
</p>
<p>
Fashionable accomplishments!
</p>
<p>
Certain substantives are, with peculiar elegance, and by persons who call
themselves <i>genteel</i>, converted into verbs: as, "Do you <i>wine?</i>"
"Will you <i>liquor?</i>"
</p>
<p>
6. An Adverb is a part of speech which, joined to a verb, an adjective, or
another adverb, serves to express quality or circumstance concerning it:
as, "She swears <span class="pagenum"><a name="link023" id="link023"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p023.jpg">023</a></span><i>dreadfully</i>; she
is <i>incorrigibly</i> lazy; and she is <i>almost continually</i> in
liquor."
</p>
<p>
7. An Adverb is generally characterised by answering to the question,
How?'how much? when? or where? as in the verse, "<i>Merrily</i> danced the
Quaker's wife," the answer to the question, How did she dance? is,
merrily.
</p>
<p>
8. Prepositions serve to connect words together, and to show the relation
between them: as, "Off <i>with</i> his head, so much <i>for</i>
Buckingham!"
</p>
<p>
9. A Conjunction is used to connect not only words, but sentences also:
as, Smith <i>and</i> Jones are happy <i>be~ cause</i> they are single. A
miss is <i>as</i> good <i>as</i> a mile.

<a href="images/032.jpg"><i>Original Size</i></a>

<p>
10. An <span class="pagenum"><a name="link024" id="link024"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p024.jpg">024</a></span>Interjection is a short
word denoting passion or emotion: as, '<i>Oh</i>, Sophonisba! Sophonisba,
<i>oh!</i>" Pshaw! Pish! Pooh! Bah! Ah! Au! Eughph! Yaw! Hum! Ha! Lauk!
La! Lor! Heigho! Well! There! &amp;c.

</h4>
<p>
Among the foregoing interjections there may, perhaps, be some unhonored by
the adoption of genius, and unknown in the domains of literature. For the
present notice of them some apology may be required, but little will be
given; their insertion may excite astonishment, but their omission would
have provoked complaint: though unprovided with a Johnsonian title to a
place in the English vocabulary, they have long been recognised by the
popular voice; and let it be remembered, that as custom supplies the
defects of legislation, so that which is not sanctioned by magisterial
authority may nevertheless be justified by vernacular usage.

CHAPTER II. OF THE ARTICLES.
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he <span class="pagenum"><a name="link025" id="link025"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p025.jpg">025</a></span>Articles in English are
two, <i>a</i> and <i>the</i>; <i>a</i> becomes <i>an</i> before a vowel,
and before an <i>h</i> which is not sounded: as, <i>an</i> exquisite, <i>an</i>
hour-glass. But if the <i>h</i> be pronounced, the <i>a</i> only is used:
as, <i>a</i> homicide, <i>a</i> homoepathist, <i>a</i> hum.
</p>
<p>
<i>A</i> or <i>an</i> is called the indefinite article, because it is
used, in a vague sense, to point out some one thing belonging to a certain
kind, but in other respects indeterminate; as,
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
"A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse!"
</pre>
<p>
So say grammarians. Eating-house keepers tell a different story. A cheese,
in common discourse, means an object of a certain shape, size, weight, and
so on, entire and perfect; so that to call half a cheese a cheese, would
constitute a flaw in an indictment against a thief who had stolen one. But
a waiter will term a fraction, or a modicum of cheese, a cheese; a
plate-full of pudding, a pudding; and a stick of celery, <i>a salary</i>.
Here we are reminded of the famous exclamation of one of these gentry:&mdash;"Sir!
there's two teas and a brandy-and-water just sloped without paying!" <i>The</i>
is termed the definite article, inasmuch as it denotes what particular
thing or things are meant as,
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
"<i>The</i> miller he stole corn,
<i>The</i> weaver he stole yarn,
And the little tailor he stole broad-cloth
To keep the three rogues warm."
</pre>
<p>
A substantive to which no article is prefixed is taken in <span
class="pagenum"><a name="link026" id="link026"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p026.jpg">026</a></span>a general sense; as,
"Applesauce is proper for goose that is, for all geese.
</p>
<p>
<br /><br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>
<a name="linkimage-0009" id="linkimage-0009"> </a>

<img src="images/035m.jpg" alt="035m " width="100%" /><br />
</div>
<h4>
<a href="images/035.jpg"><i>Original Size</i></a>
</h4>
<p>
A few additional remarks may advantageously be made with respect to the
articles. The mere substitution of the definite for the indefinite article
is capable of changing entirely the meaning of a sentence. "That is <i>a</i>
ticket" is the assertion of a certain fact; but "That is <i>the</i>
ticket!" means something which is quite different.
</p>
<p>
The article is not prefixed to a proper name; as, Stubbs, Wiggins, Brown
or Hobson, except for the sake of distinguishing a particular family, or
description of persons; as, He is <i>a</i> Burke; that is, one of the
Burkes, or <i>a</i> person resembling Burke.
</p>
<p>
The <span class="pagenum"><a name="link027" id="link027"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p027.jpg">027</a></span>definite article is
frequently used with adverbs in the comparative and superlative degree:
as, "<i>The</i> longer I live, <i>the</i> taller, I grow or, as we have
all heard the showman say, "This here, gentlemen and ladies, <span
class="pagenum"><a name="link028" id="link028"></a><a

SECTION I. OF SUBSTANTIVES IN GENERAL.
</h2>
<h3>
Substantives are either proper or common.
</h3>
<p>
Proper names, or substantives, are the names belonging to individuals: as
William, Birmingham.
</p>
<p>
These are sometimes converted into nicknames, of improper names: as Bill,
Brummagem.
</p>
<p>
Common names, or substantives, denote kinds containing many sorts, or
sorts containing many individual» under them: as brute, beast, bumpkin,
cherub, infant, goblin, &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
Proper names, when an article is prefixed to them, are employed as common
names: as, "They thought him a perfect <i>Chesterfield</i>; he quite
astonished the <i>Browns</i>."
</p>
<p>
Common names, on the other hand, are made to denote individuals, by the
addition of articles or pronouns: as,
</p>
<p>
"There was <i>a</i> little man, and he had little gun."

<h2>
SECTION II. OF GENDER.
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he distinction between nouns with regard to sex is called Gender. There
are three genders: the Masculine, the Feminine, and the Neuter.
</p>
<p>
The masculine gender belongs to animals of the male kind: as, a fop, a
jackass, a boar, a poet, a lion.
</p>
<p>
The feminine gender is peculiar to animals of the female kind: as, a
poetess, a lioness, a goose.
</p>
<p>
The <span class="pagenum"><a name="link030" id="link030"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p030.jpg">030</a></span>neuter gender is that
of objects which are neither males nor females: as, a toast, a tankard, a
pot, a pipe, a pudding, a pie, a sausage, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
We might go on to enumerate an infinity of objects of the neuter gender,
of all sorts and kinds; but in the selection of the foregoing examples we
have been guided by two considerations:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
1. The desire of exciting agreeable emotions in the mind of the reader.
</p>
<p>
2. The wish to illustrate the following proposition, "That almost
everything nice is also neuter."
</p>
<p>
Except, however, a nice young lady, a nice duck, and one or two other nice
things, which we do not at present remember.
</p>
<p>
Some neuter substantives are by a figure of speech converted into the
masculine or feminine gender: thus we say of the sun, that when he shines
upon a Socialist, t he shines upon a thief; and of the moon, that she
affects the minds of lovers.

<p>
There <span class="pagenum"><a name="link031" id="link031"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p031.jpg">031</a></span>are certain nouns with
which notions of strength, vigor, and the like qualities, are more
particularly connected; and these are the neuter substantives which are
figuratively rendered masculine. On the other hand, beauty, amiability,
and so forth, are held to invest words with a feminine character. Thus the
sun is said to be masculine, and the moon feminine. But for our own part,
and our view is confirmed by the discoveries of astronomy, we believe that
the sun is called masculine from his supporting and sustaining the moon,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="link032" id="link032"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p032.jpg">032</a></span>and finding her the
wherewithal to shine away as she does of a night, when all quiet people
are in bed; and from his being obliged to keep such a family of stars
besides.

<h4>
<a href="images/040.jpg"><i>Original Size</i></a>
</h4>
<p>
The moon, we think, is accounted feminine, because she is thus maintained
and kept up in her splendor, like a fine lady, by her husband the sun.
Furthermore, the moon is continually changing; on which account alone she
might be referred to the feminine gender. The earth is feminine, tricked
out, as she is, with gems and flowers. Cities and towns are likewise
feminine, because there are as many windings, turnings, and little odd
corners in them as there are in the female mind. A ship is feminine,
inasmuch as she is blown about by every wind. Virtue is feminine by
courtesy. Fortune and misfortune, like mother and daughter, are both
feminine. The Church is feminine, because she is married to the state; or
married to the state because she is feminine&mdash;we do not know which.
Time is masculine, because he is so trifled with by the ladies.
</p>
<p>
The English language distinguishes the sex in three manners; namely,
</p>
<p>
1. By different words; as,
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
MALE.      FEMALE.

Bachelor    Maid.

Brother     Sister.

Wizard      Father And several other

Witch      Mother, &amp;c.

Words we don't mention,
(Pray pardon the crime,)
Worth your attention,
But wanting in rhyme.
</pre>
<p>
2. By <span class="pagenum"><a name="link033" id="link033"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p033.jpg">033</a></span>a difference of
termination; as,
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
MALE.    FEMALÉ.

Poet     Poetess.

Lion     Lioness, &amp;c.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
3. By a noun, pronoun, or adjective being prefixed to the substantive;
as,
male.         female.

A cock-lobster    A hen-lobster.

A jack-ass        A jenny-ass (vernacular.)

A man-servant,    A maid-servant, or flunkey. or Abigail.

A male flirt (A common animal)   A female flirt (A rare animal.)
</pre>
<p>
We have heard it said, that every Jack has his Jill. That may be; but it
is by no means true that every cock has his hen; for there is a
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Cock-swain, but no Hen-swain.

Cock-eye, but no Hen-eye.

Cock-ade, but no Hen-ade.

Cock-atrice, but no Hen-atrice.

Cock-horse, but no Hen-horse.

Cock-ney, but no Hen-ney.
</pre>
<p>
Then we have a weather-cock, but no weather-hen; a tum-cock, but no
turn-hen; and many a jolly cock, but not one jolly hen; unless we except
some of those by whom their mates are pecked.
</p>
<p>
Some words; as, parent, child, cousin, friend, neighbour, servant and
several others, are either male or female, according to circumstances.
</p>
<p>
It is a great pity that our language is so poor in the terminations that
denote gender. Were we to say of a woman <span class="pagenum"><a
name="link034" id="link034"></a><a href="../44802-page-images/p034.jpg">034</a></span>that
she is a rogue, a knave, a scamp, or a vagabond, we feel that we should
use, not only strong but improper expressions. Yet we have no
corresponding terms to apply, in case of necessity, to the female. Why is
this? Doubtless because we never want them. For the same reason, our
forefathers transmitted to us the words, philosopher, astronomer,
philologer, and so forth, without any feminine equivalent. Alas! for the
wisdom of our ancestors! They never calculated on the March of Intellect.

SECTION III. OF NUMBER.

two, three, four, five poets; and so on, ad infinitum.

<p>
The singular number expresses one object only; as a towel, a viper.
</p>
<p>
The plural signifies more objects than one; as, towels, vipers.

Some nouns are used only in the singular number; dirt, pitch, tallow,
grease, filth, butter, asparagus, &amp;c.; others only in the plural; as,

<p>
Some words are the same in both numbers; as, sheep, swine, and some

SECTION IV. OF CASE.
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>here is nearly as much difference between Latin and English substantives,
with respect to the number of cases pertaining to each, as there is
between a quack-doctor <span class="pagenum"><a name="link036" id="link036"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p036.jpg">036</a></span>and a physician; for
while in Latin sub-stantives have six cases, in English they have but
three. But the analogy should not be strained too far; for the fools in
the world (who furnish the quack with his cases) more than double the
number of the wise.

<h4>
<a href="images/045.jpg"><i>Original Size</i></a>
</h4>
<p>
The cases of substantives are these: the Nominative, the Possessive or
Genitive, and the Objective or Accusative.
</p>
<p>
The Nominative Case merely expresses the name of a thing, or the subject
of the verb: as, "The doctors differ;"&mdash;"The patient dies!"
</p>
<p>
Possession, which is nine points of the law, is what is signified by the
Possessive Case. This case is distinguished by an apostrophe, with the
letter <i>s</i> subjoined to it: as, My soul's idol!"&mdash;"A pudding's
end."
</p>
<p>
But <span class="pagenum"><a name="link037" id="link037"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p037.jpg">037</a></span>when the plural ends in
<i>s</i>, the apostrophe only is retained, and the other <i>s</i> is
omitted: as, "The Ministers' Step;"&mdash;"The Rogues' March;"&mdash;"Crocodiles'
tears&mdash;"Butchers' mourning."
</p>
<p>
When the singular terminates in <i>ss</i>, the letter <i>s</i> is
sometimes, in like manner, dispensed with: as, "For goodness' sake!"&mdash;"For
righteousness' sake!" Nevertheless, we have no objection to "Burgess's"
Stout.
</p>
<p>
The Objective Case follows a verb active, and expresses the object of an
action, or of a relation: as "Spring beat Bill;" that is, Bill or "William
Neate." Hence, perhaps, the phrase, "I'll lick you <i>elegant</i>." The
Objective Case is also used with a preposition: as, "You are in a mess."
</p>
<p>
English substantives may be declined in the following manner:
</p>
<h3>
SINGULAR.
</h3>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
What is the nominative case
Of her who used to wash your face,
Your hair to comb, your boots to lace?
<i>A mother!</i>

<i>A mother's!</i>

And shall I the objective show?

<h2>
SECTION I. OF THE NATURE OF ADJECTIVES AND THE DEGREES OF COMPARISON.
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>n English Adjective, whatever may be its gender, number, or case, like a
rusty weathercock, never varies. Thus we say, "A certain cabinet; certain
rogues." But as a rusty weathercock may vary in being more or less rusty,
so an adjective varies in the degrees of comparison.
</p>
<p>
The degrees of comparison, like the Genders, the Graces, the Fates, the
Kings of Cologne, the Weird Sisters, and many other things, are three; the
Positive, the Comparative, and the Superlative.
</p>
<p>
The Positive state simply expresses the quality of an object; as, fat,
ugly, foolish.
</p>
<p>
The Comparative degree increases or lessens the signification <span
class="pagenum"><a name="link039" id="link039"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p039.jpg">039</a></span>of the positive; as
fatter, uglier, more foolish, less foolish.
</p>
<p>
The Superlative decree increases or lessens the positive to the highest or
lowest degree; as fattest, ugliest, most foolish, least foolish.
</p>
<p>
Amongst the ancients, Ulysses must have been the <i>fattest</i>, because
nobody could <i>compass</i> him.
</p>
<p>
Aristides the Just was the ugliest, because he was so very <i>plain</i>.
</p>
<p>
The most <i>foolish</i>, undoubtedly, was Homer; for who was more <i>natural</i>
than he?
</p>
<p>
The positive becomes the comparative by the addition of <i>r</i> or <i>er</i>;
and the superlative by the addition of <i>st</i> or <i>est</i> to the end
of it; as, brown, browner, brownest; stout, stouter, stoutest; heavy,
heavier, heaviest; wet, wetter, wettest. The adverbs more and most,
prefixed to the adjective, also form the superlative degree; as, heavy,
more heavy, most heavy.
</p>
<p>
Monosyllables are usually compared by er and est, and dissyllables by more
and most; except dissyllables ending in y or in le before a mute, or those
which are accented on the last syllable; for these, like monosyllables,
easily admit of er and est. But these terminations are scarcely ever used
in comparing words of more than two syllables.
</p>
<p>
We have some words, which, from custom, are irregular in respect of
comparison; as, good, better, best; bad, worse, worst, &amp;c.; but the
Yankee's "notion" of comparison was decidedly funny; "My uncle's a
tarnation rogue; but I'm a tarnationer."

<h2>
SECTION II. A FEW REMARKS ON THE SUBJECT OF COMPARISON.
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">L</span>indley <span class="pagenum"><a name="link040" id="link040"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p040.jpg">040</a></span>Murray judiciously
observes, that "if we consider the subject of comparison attentively, we
shall perceive that the degrees of it are infinite in number, or at least
indefinite:" and he proceeds to say, "A mountain is larger than a mite; by
how many degrees? How much bigger is the earth than a grain of sand? By
how many degrees was Socrates wiser than Alci-biades? or by how many is
snow whiter than this paper? It is plain," quoth Lindley, "that to these
and the like questions no definite answers can be returned."
</p>
<p>
No; but an impertinent one may. Ask the first news-boy you meet, any one
of these questions, and see if he does not immediately respond, 'Ax my eye
or, "As much again as half."
</p>
<p>
But when quantity can be exactly measured, the degrees of excess may be
exactly ascertained. A foot is just twelve times as long as an inch; a
tailor is nine times less than a man.
</p>
<p>
Moreover, to compensate for the indefiniteness of the degrees of
comparison, we use certain adverbs and words of like import, whereby we
render our meaning tolerably intelligible; as, "Byron was a <i>much
greater</i> poet than Muggins."
</p>
<p>
"Honey is <i>a great deal</i> sweeter than wax."
</p>
<p>
"Sugar is <i>considerably</i> more pleasant than the cane."
</p>
<p>
"Maria says, that Dick the butcher is <i>by far</i> the most killing young
man she knows."
</p>
<p>
The words very, exceedingly, and the like, placed before the positive,
give it the force of the superlative; and <span class="pagenum"><a
name="link041" id="link041"></a><a href="../44802-page-images/p041.jpg">041</a></span>this
is called by some the superlative of eminence, as distinguished from the
superlative of comparison. Thus, Very Reverend is termed the superlative
of eminence, although it is the title of a dean, not of a cardinal; and
Most Reverend, the appellation of an Archbishop, is called the superlative
of comparison.
</p>
<p>
A <i>Bishop</i>, in our opinion, is <i>Most Excellent</i>.
</p>
<p>
The comparative is sometimes so employed as to express the same
pre-eminence or inferiority as the superlative. For instance; the
sentence, "Of all the cultivators of science, the botanist is the most
crafty," has the same meaning as the following: "The botanist is more
crafty than any other cultivator of science." Why? some of our readers
will ask&mdash;
</p>
<p>
Because he is acquainted with all sorts of <i>plants.</i>

The above is what is called personal language. How many different things
one word serves to express in English! A pronoun may be as personal as
possible, and yet nobody will take offence at it.
</p>
<p>
There are five Personal Pronouns; namely, I, thou, he, she, it; with their
plurals, we, ye or you, they.
</p>
<p>
Personal Pronouns admit of person, number, gender, and case.
</p>
<p>
Pronouns have three persons in each number.

<p>
I, is the first person.

<p>
Thou, is the second person.

Of the three persons, the first is the most universally admired.
</p>
<p>
The second is the object of much adulation and flattery, and now and then
of a little abuse.
</p>
<p>
The third person is generally made small account of; and, amongst other
grievances, suffers a great deal from being frequently bitten about the
back.
</p>
<p>
The Numbers of pronouns, like those of substantives, are, as we have
already seen, two; the singular and the plural.
</p>
<p>
In addressing yourself to anybody, it is customary to use the second
person plural instead of the singular. This practice most probably arose
from a notion, that to be thought twice the man that the speaker was,
gratified the vanity of the person addressed. Thus, the <span
class="pagenum"><a name="link045" id="link045"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p045.jpg">045</a></span>French put a double
Monsieur on the backs of their letters.
</p>
<p>
Editors say "We," instead of "I," out of modesty.
</p>
<p>
The Quakers continue to say "thee" and "thou," in the use of which
pronouns, as well as in the wearing of broad-brimmed hats and of stand-up
collars, they perceive a peculiar sanctity.
</p>
<p>
Gender has to do only with the third person singular of the pronouns, he,
she, it. He is masculine; she is feminine; it is neuter.
</p>
<p>
Pronouns have the like cases with substantives; the nominative, the
possessive, and the objective.
</p>
<p>
Would that they were the hardest cases to be met with in this country!
</p>
<p>
The personal pronouns are thus declined:&mdash;

<h2>
SECTION II. OF THE RELATIVE PRONOUNS.
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he Pronouns called Relative are such as relate, for the most part, to
some word or phrase, called the antecedent, on account of its going
before: they are, <i>who</i>, <i>which</i>, and <i>that</i>: as, "The man
who does not drink enough when he can get it, is a fool: but he that
drinks too much is a beast."
</p>
<p>
<i>What</i> is usually equivalent to <i>that which</i>, and is, therefore,
a kind of compound relative, containing both the antecedent and the
relative; as, "You want what you'll very soon have!" that is to say, the
thing which you will very soon have.
</p>
<p>
<i>Who</i> is applied to persons, <i>which</i> to animals and things
without life; as, "He is a gentleman who keeps a horse and lives
respectably." To the dog which pinned the old woman, they cried, '<i>Cosar!</i>'"
</p>
<p>
That, as a relative, is used to prevent the too frequent repetition of <i>who
and which</i>, and is applied both to persons and things; as, He that
stops the bottle is a Cork man."
</p>
<p>
"This is the <i>house that</i> Jack built."
</p>
<p>
Who is of both numbers; and so is an Editor; for, according to what we
observed just now, he is both singular and plural. Who, we repeat, is of
both numbers, and is thus declined:&mdash;

</p>
<p>
"The roe, poor dear, laments amain,
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Who, which, and what, when they are used in asking questions, are called
Interrogatives; as, "Who is Mr. Walker?". "Which is the left side of a
round plum-pudding?"
</p>
<p>
"What is the damage?"
</p>
<p>
Those who, have made popular phraseology their study, will have found that

<h2>
SECTION III. OF THE ADJECTIVE PRONOUNS.
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>djective pronouns partake of the nature of both pronouns and adjectives.
They may be subdivided into four sorts: the possessive, the distributive,
the demonstrative, and the indefinite.
</p>
<p>
The possessive pronouns are those which imply possession or property. Of
these there are seven; namely, my, thy, his, her, our, your, their.
</p>
<p>
The word self is added to possessives; as, myself, yourself, "Says I to
myself, says I." Self is also sometimes <span class="pagenum"><a
name="link049" id="link049"></a><a href="../44802-page-images/p049.jpg">049</a></span>used
with personal pronouns; as, himself, itself, themselves. His self is a
common, but not a proper expression.
</p>
<p>
<br /><br />

<img src="images/057m.jpg" alt="057m " width="100%" /><br />
</div>
<h4>
<a href="images/057.jpg"><i>Original Size</i></a>
</h4>
<p>
The distributive are three; each, every, either; they denote the
individual persons or things' separately, which, when taken together, make
up a number. Each is used when two or more persons or things are mentioned
singly; as, "each of the Catos;" "each or the Browns."
</p>
<p>
Every relates to one out of several; as,
</p>
<p>
"Every mare is a horse, but every horse is not a mare."
</p>
<p>
Either refers to one out of two; as,
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
"When I between two jockeys ride,
I have a knave on either side."
</pre>
<p>
Neither signifies "not either;" as, "Neither of the Bacons was related to
Hogg."
</p>
<p>
The demonstrative pronouns precisely point out the subjects to which they
relate; such are this and that, with their plurals these and those; as,
"This is a Hoosier lad; that is a Yankee school-master."
</p>
<p>
This refers to the nearest person or thing, and to the latter or last
mentioned; that to the most distant, and to the former or first mentioned;
as, "This is a man; that is a nondescript."
</p>
<p>
"At the period of the Reformation in Scotland, a curious contrast between
the ancient and modern ecclesiastical systems was observed; for while that
had been always maintained by a Bull, this was now supported by a Knox"
</p>
<p>
The indefinite are those which express their subjects in an indefinite or
general manner; as, some, other, any, one, all, such, &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
When the definite article the comes before the word other, <span
class="pagenum"><a name="link050" id="link050"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p050.jpg">050</a></span>those who do not know
better, are accustomed to strike out the he in the, and to say, t'other.
</p>
<p>
The same persons also use other in the comparative degree; for sometimes,
instead of saying quite the reverse, or perhaps reverse, they avail
themselves of the expression more t'other.
</p>
<p>
So much for the pronouns.

<h2>
SECTION I. OF THE NATURE OF VERBS IN GENERAL.
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he nature of Verbs in general, and that in all languages, is, that they
are the most difficult things in the Grammar.
</p>
<p>
Verbs are divided into Active, Passive, and Neuter; and also into Regular,
Irregular, and Defective. To these divisions we beg to add another; Verbs
Comic.
</p>
<p>
A Verb Active implies an agent, and an object acted upon; as, to love; "I
love Wilhelmina Stubbs." Here, I am the agent; that is, the lover; and
Wilhelmina Stubbs is the object acted upon, or the beloved object.
</p>
<p>
A Verb Passive expresses the suffering, feeling, or undergoing of
something; and therefore implies an object acted upon, and an agent by
which it is acted upon; as, to be loved; "Wilhelmina Stubbs is loved by
me."
</p>
<p>
A <span class="pagenum"><a name="link051" id="link051"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p051.jpg">051</a></span>Verb Neuter expresses
neither action nor passion, but a state of being; as, I bounce, I lie.
</p>
<p>
"Gracious, Major!"
</p>
<p>
<br /><br />

</div>
<h4>
<a href="images/060.jpg"><i>Original Size</i></a>
</h4>
<p>
Of Verbs Regular, Irregular, and Defective, we shall have somewhat to say
hereafter.
</p>
<p>
Verbs Comic are, for the most part, verbs which cannot be found in the
dictionary, and are used to express ordinary actions in a jocular manner;
as, to "bolt," to "mizzle," which signify to go or to depart; to "bone,"
to "prig," that is to say, to steal; to "collar," which means to seize, an
expression probably derived <span class="pagenum"><a name="link052"
id="link052"></a><a href="../44802-page-images/p052.jpg">052</a></span>from
the mode of prehension, or rather apprehension characteristic of the New
Police, as it is one very much in the mouths of those who most frequently
come in contact with that body: to "liquor,"'or drink; to "grub," or eat;
to "sell," or deceive, &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
Under the head of Verbs Comic, the Yankeeisms, I "calculate," I "reckon,"
I "realise," I "guess," and the like, may also be properly enumerated.
</p>
<p>
Auxiliary, or helping Verbs (by the way we marvel that the New Englanders
do not call their servants auxiliaries instead of helps) are those, by the
help of which we are chiefly enabled to conjugate our verbs in English.
They are, do, be, have, shall, will, may, can, with their variations; and
let and must, which have no variation.
</p>
<p>
Let, however, when it is <i>anything but a helping</i> verb, as, for
instance, when it signifies to <i>hinder</i>, makes let-test and letteth.
The phrase, "This House to Let," generally used instead of "to be let,"
meaning in fact, the reverse of what is intended to convey, is really a
piece of comic English.
</p>
<p>
To verbs belong Number, Person, Mood, and Tense. These may be called the
properties of a verb; and like those of opium, they are soporiferous
properties. There are two very important objects which the writer of every
book has, or ought to have in view, to get a reader who is wide awake, and
to keep him so:&mdash;the latter of which, when Number, Person, Mood, and
Tense are to be treated of, is no such easy matter; seeing that the said
writer is then in some danger of going to sleep himself. Never mind. If we
nod, let the reader wink. What can't be cured must be endured.

<h2>
SECTION III. OF MOODS AND PARTICIPLES.
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>ood or Mode is a particular form of the verb, or a certain variation
which it undergoes, showing the manner in which the being, action, or
passion, is represented.
</p>
<p>
The moods of verbs are five, the Indicative, the Imperative, the
Potential, the Subjunctive, and the Infinitive.
</p>
<p>
The Indicative Mood simply points out or declares a thing: as, "He
teaches, he is taught or it asks a question: as, "Does he teach? Is he
taught?"
</p>
<p>
Q. Why <span class="pagenum"><a name="link054" id="link054"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p054.jpg">054</a></span>is old age the best
teacher?
</p>
<p>
A. Because he gives you the most wrinkles.
</p>
<p>
Q. Why does a rope support a rope-dancer?
</p>
<p>
A. Because it is taught.
</p>
<p>
The Imperative Mood commands, exhorts, entreats, or permits: as, "Vanish
thou; trot ye; let us hop; be off!"
</p>
<p>
The Potential Mood implies possibility or liberty, power, will, or
obligation: as, "A waiter may be honest. Yuu may stand upon truth or lie.
I can filch. He would cozen. They should learn."
</p>
<p>
The Subjunctive Mood is used to represent a thing as done conditionally;
and is preceded by a conjunction, expressed or understood, and accompanied
by another verb: as, "<i>If</i> the skies should fall, larks would be
caught,"
</p>
<p>
"Were I to punch your head, I should serve you right:" that is, "<i>if</i>
I were to punch your head."
</p>
<p>
The Infinitive Mood expresses a thing generally, without limitation, and
without any distinction of number or person: as, "to quarrel, to fight, to
be licked."
</p>
<p>
The Participle is a peculiar form of the verb, and is so called, because
it participates in the properties both of a verb and of an adjective: as,
"May I have the pleasure of <i>dancing</i> with you?"
</p>
<p>
"<i>Mounted</i> on a tub he addressed the bystanders."
</p>
<p>
"<i>Having</i> uplifted a stave, they departed."
</p>
<p>
The Participles are three; the Present or Active, the Perfect or Passive,
and the Compound Perfect: as, "I felt nervous at the thought of <i>popping</i>
the question, but that once <i>popped</i>, I was not sorry for <i>having
popped</i> it."
</p>
<p>
The <span class="pagenum"><a name="link055" id="link055"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p055.jpg">055</a></span>worst of <i>popping</i>
the question is, that the <i>report</i> is always sure to get abroad.

<h2>
SECTION IV. OF THE TENSES.
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>ense is the distinction of time, and consists of six divisions, namely,
the Present, the Imperfect, the Perfect, the Pluperfect, and the First and
Second Future Tenses.
</p>
<p>
Time is also distinguished by a fore-lock, scythe, and hour-glass; but the
youthful reader must bear in mind, that these things are not to be
confounded with tenses.

<h4>
<a href="images/064.jpg"><i>Original Size</i></a>
</h4>
<p>
The <span class="pagenum"><a name="link056" id="link056"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p056.jpg">056</a></span>Present Tense, as its
name implies, represents an action or event occurring at the present time:
as "I lament; rogues prosper; the mob rules."
</p>
<p>
The Imperfect Tense represents a past action or event, but which, like a
mutton chop, may be either thoroughly done, or not thoroughly done; were
it <i>meet</i>, we should say, <i>under-done</i>: as,
</p>
<p>
"When I was a little boy some fifteen years ago,
</p>
<p>
My mammy doted on me&mdash;Lork! she made me quite a show."
</p>
<p>
"When our reporter left, the Honorable Gentleman was still on his legs."
</p>
<p>
The legs of most "Honorable Gentlemen" must be tolerably stout ones; for
the "majority" do not stand on trifles. However, we are not going to
commit ourselves, like some folks, nor to get committed, like other folks;
so we will leave "Honorable Gentlemen" to manage matters their own way.
</p>
<p>
The Perfect Tense declares a thing to have been done at some time, though
an indefinite one, antecedent to the present time. That, however, which
the Perfect Tense represents as done, is completely, or, as we say of a
green one, when he is humbugged by the thimble-rig people, regularly done;
as, "I have been out on the river."
</p>
<p>
"I have caught a crab." Catching a crab is a thing regularly (in another
sense than completely) done, when civic swains pull young ladies up to
Richmond. We beg to inform persons unacquainted with aquatic phraseology,
that "pulling up" young ladies, or others, is a very different thing from
"pulling up" an omnibus conductor or a cabman. What an equivocal language
is ours! How much less agreeable <span class="pagenum"><a name="link057"
id="link057"></a><a href="../44802-page-images/p057.jpg">057</a></span>to
be "pulled up" at the Police office than to be "pulled up" in a row-boat!
how wide the discrepancy between "pulling up" radishes and "pulling up"
horses!
</p>
<p>
The Pluperfect Tense represents a thing as doubly past; that is, as past
previously to some other point of time also past; as, "I fell in love
before I <i>had arrived</i> at years of discretion."
</p>
<p>
<br /><br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>
<a name="linkimage-0020" id="linkimage-0020"> </a>
</p>
<div class="fig" style="width:45%;">
<img src="images/066m.jpg" alt="066m " width="100%" /><br />
</div>
<h4>
<a href="images/066.jpg"><i>Original Size</i></a>
</h4>
<p>
The First Future Tense represents the action as yet to come, either at a
certain or an uncertain time; as, "The tailor <i>will send</i> my coat
home to-morrow; and when I find it perfectly convenient, I <i>shall pay</i>
him." The Second Future intimates that the action will be completed <span
class="pagenum"><a name="link058" id="link058"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p058.jpg">058</a></span>at or before the time
of another future action or event; as, "I wonder how many conquests I <i>shall
have made</i> by to-morrow morning."
</p>
<p>
N. B. One ball is often the means of killing a great many people.
</p>
<p>
The consideration of the tenses suggests various moral reflections to the
thinking mind. A couple of examples will perhaps suffice;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
1. <i>Present</i>, though moderate fruition, is preferable to splendid,
but contingent futurity; i. e. A bird in the hand is worth two in the
bush.
</p>
<p>
2. <i>Imperfect</i> nutrition is less to be deprecated than privation of
aliment;&mdash;a new way of putting an old proverb, which we need not
again insert, respecting half a loaf.

<h2>
SECTION V. THE CONJUGATION OF THE AUXILIARY VERBS TO HAVE AND TO BE.
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>e have observed that boys, in conjugating verbs, give no indications of
delight, except that which an ingenious disposition always feels in the
acquisition of knowledge. Now, having arrived at that part of the Grammar
in which it becomes necessary that these same verbs should be considered,
we feel ourselves in an awkward dilemma. The omission of the conjugations
is a <i>serious</i> omission&mdash;which, of course, is objectionable in a
<i>comic</i> work&mdash;and the insertion of them would be equally
serious, and therefore quite as improper. What <i>shall</i> we do? We will
adopt a middle course; referring the reader to Murray and other talented
authors for full information on these matters; and requesting him to be
content with our confining ourselves <span class="pagenum"><a
name="link059" id="link059"></a><a href="../44802-page-images/p059.jpg">059</a></span>to
what is more especially suitable to these pages&mdash;a glance at the <i>Comicalities</i>
of verbs.
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
If being a youngster I had not been smitten,
Of having been jilted I should not complain,
Take warning from me all ye lads who are bitten,
When this part of Grammar occurs to your brain.
</pre>
<p>
As there is a certain <i>intensity</i> of feeling abroad, which renders
people indisposed to trouble themselves with verbal matters, we shall take
the liberty of making very short work of the Regular Verbs. Even Murray
can only afford to conjugate one example,&mdash;To Love. The learner must
amplify this part of the Grammar for himself: and we recommend him to
substitute for "to love," some word less harrowing to a sensitive mind:
as, "to fleece, to tax," verbs which excite disagreeable emotions only in
a sordid one; and which also, by association of ideas, conduct us to
useful reflections on Political Economy. We advise all whom it may
concern, however, to pay the greatest attention to this part of the
Grammar, and before they come to the Verbs Regular, to make a particular
study of the Auxiliary Verbs: not only for the excellent reasons set
forth, in "Tristram Shandy," but also to avoid those awkward mistakes in
which the Comicalities of the Verbs, or Verbal Comicalities, chiefly
consist.

"Did it rain to-morrow?" asked Monsieur Grenouille.

"Yes it was!" replied Monsieur Crapaud.

We propose the following as an <i>auxiliary mode</i> of conjugating verbs:&mdash;"I
love to roam on the crested foam, Thou lovest to roam on the crested foam,
He loves to roam on the crested foam, We love to roam on the <span

love to roam on the crested foam, They love to roam on the crested foam,"
&amp;c.
</p>
<p>
The Auxiliary Verbs, too, are very useful when a peculiar emphasis is
required: as, "I shall give you a drubbing!"
</p>
<p>
"Will you?"
</p>
<p>
"I know a trick worth two of that."

"Do you, though?"

the indicative mood, and their perfect participle, by adding to the verb
ed, or d only when the verb ends in e: as,

conjugation of the regular active verb, To Love; but we have already
assigned a good reason for omitting it; besides which we have to say, that
we think it a verb highly unfit for conjugation by youth, as it tends to
put ideas into their heads which they would otherwise never have thought
of; and it is moreover our opinion, that several of our most gifted poets
may, with reason, have attributed the so unfortunate attachments which,
though formed in early youth, served to embitter their whole lives, to the
poison which they thus sucked in with the milk, so to speak, of their
Mother Tongue, the Grammar.

<p>
Verbs <span class="pagenum"><a name="link062" id="link062"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p062.jpg">062</a></span>Passive are said to be
regular, when their perfect participle is formed by the addition of d, or
ed to the verb: as, from the verb "To bless," is formed the passive, "I am
blessed, I was blessed, I shall be blessed," &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
The conjugation of a passive verb is nothing more than the repetition of
that of the auxiliary To Be, the perfect participle being added.

href="../44802-page-images/p064.jpg">064</a></span>as great a dislike as
the youngest of our readers can have to repetitions, we shall not say what
an adverb is over again. It is, nevertheless, right to observe, that some
adverbs are compared: as, far, farther, farthest; near, nearer, nearest.
In comparing those which end in ly, we use more and most: as, slowly, more
slowly, most slowly.
</p>
<p>
There are a great many adverbs in the English Language: their number is
probably even greater than that of abusive epithets. They are divisible
into certain classes; the chief of which are Number, Order, Place, Time,
Quantity, Manner or Quality, Doubt, Affirmation, Negation, Interrogation,
and Comparison.
</p>
<p>
A nice little list, truly! and perhaps some of our readers may suppose
that we are going to exemplify it at length: if so, all we can say with
regard to their expectation is, that we wish they may get it gratified. In
the meantime, we will not turn our Grammar into a dictionary, to please
anybody. However, we have no objection to a brief illustration of the uses
and properties of adverbs, as contained in the following passage:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Formerly, when first I began to preach and to teach, whithersoever I
went, the little boys followed me, and now and then pelted me with
brick-bats, as heretofore they pelted Ebenezer Grimes. And whensoever I
opened my mouth, straightways the ungodly began to crow. Oftentimes was I
hit in the mouth with an orange: yea, and once, moreover, with a rotten
egg: whereat <span class="pagenum"><a name="link065" id="link065"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p065.jpg">065</a></span>there was much
laughter, which, notwithstanding, I took in good part, and wiped my face
and looked pleasantly. For peradventure I said, they will listen to my
sermon; yea, and after that we may have a collection. So I was nowise
discomfited; wherefore I advise thee, Brother Habakkuk, to take no heed of
thy persecutors, seeing that I, whereas I was once little better off than
thyself, have now a chapel of mine own. And herein let thy mind be
comforted, that, preach as much as thou wilt against the Bishop, thou wilt
not, therefore, in these days, be in danger of the pillory. Howbeit,"
&amp;c.

CHAPTER VIII. OF PREPOSITIONS.

<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>repositions are, for the most part, put before nouns and pronouns: as,
"out of the frying-pan into the fire."
</p>
<p>
The preposition of is sometimes used as a part of speech of peculiar
signification, and one to which no name has as yet been applied: as, "What
you been doing of?"
</p>
<p>
At and up are not rarely used as verbs, but we should scarcely have been
justified in so classing them by the authority of any polite writer; such
use of them being confined to the vulgar: as, "Now then, Bill, at him

<p>
But <span class="pagenum"><a name="link067" id="link067"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p067.jpg">067</a></span>our conjunctions are
used to connect words and sentences, and have nothing to do with the
joining of hands. They are chiefly of two sorts, the Copulative and
Disjunctive.
</p>
<p>
The Copulative Conjunction is employed for the connection or continuation
of a sentence: as, "Jack and Gill went up the Hill,"
</p>
<p>
"I will sing a song if Gubbins will."
</p>
<p>
"A thirsty man is like a Giant because he is a Grog for drink."
</p>
<p>
The Conjunction Disjunctive is used not only for purposes of connection,
but also to express opposition of meaning in different degrees: as, "We
pay less for our letters, but shall have to pay more for our coats: they
have lightened our postage, but they will increase our taxes.
</p>
<p>
Conjunctions are the hooks and eyes of Language, in which, as well as in
dress, it is very possible to make an awkward use of them: as, "For if the
year consist of 365 days 6 hours, and January have 31 days, then the
relation between the corpuscular theory of light and the new views of Mr.
Owen is at once subverted: for 'When Ignorance is bliss, 'tis folly to be
wise because 1760 yards make a mile; and it is universally acknowledged
that 'war is the madness of many for the gain of a few therefore Sir Isaac
Newton was right in supposing the diamond to be combustible." The Siamese
twins, it must be admitted, form a singular conjunction.

<p>
A tin pot fastened to a dog's tail is a disagreeable conjunction to the
unfortunate animal.

A happy pair may be regarded as an uncommon conjunction.

CHAPTER X. OF DERIVATION.
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>hose who know Latin, Greek, Saxon, and the other languages from which our
own is formed, do not require to <span class="pagenum"><a name="link069"
id="link069"></a><a href="../44802-page-images/p069.jpg">069</a></span>be
instructed in philological derivation; and on those who do not understand
the said tongues, such instruction would be thrown away. In what manner
English words are derived, one from another, the generality of persons
know very well: there are, however, a few words and phrases, which it is
expedient to trace to their respective sources; not only because such an
exercise is of itself delightful to the inquiring mind; but because we
shall thereby be furnished (as we hope to show) with a test by means of
which, on hearing an expression for the first time, we shall be able, in
most instances, to decide at once respecting its nature and quality.
</p>
<p>
These words, of which many have but recently come into vogue, which,
though by no means improper or immoral, are absolutely unutterable in any
polite assembly. It is not, at first, very easy to see what can be the
objection to their use; but derivation explains it for us in the most
satisfactory manner. The truth is, that the expressions in question take
their origin from various trades and occupations, in which they have for
the most part, a literal meaning; and we now perceive what horrible
suspicions respecting one's birth, habits, and education, their figurative
employment would be likely to excite. To make the matter indisputably
clear, we will explain our position by a few examples.

<p>
Numerous examples, similar to the foregoing, will, no doubt, present
themselves, in addition, to the mind of the enlightened student. We have
not, however, quite done yet with our remarks on this division of our
subject. The intrinsic vulgarity of all modes of speech which may be
traced to mean or disreputable persons, will, of course, not be
questioned. But&mdash;and as we have got hold of a nice bone, we may as
well get all the marrow we can out of it&mdash;the principle which is now
under consideration has a much wider range than is apparent at first
sight.
</p>
<p>
Now we will suppose a red-hot lover addressing the goddess of his idolatry&mdash;by
the way, how strange it is, that these goddesses should be always having
their temples <span class="pagenum"><a name="link071" id="link071"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p071.jpg">071</a></span>on fire, that a Queen
of Hearts should ever be seated on a burning throne!&mdash;but to return
to the lover: he was to say something. Well, then, let A. B. be the lover.
He expresses himself thus:
</p>
<p>
"Mary, my earthly hopes are centred in you. You need not doubt me; my
heart is true as the dial to the sun. Words cannot express how much I love
you. Nor is my affection an ordinary feeling: it is a more exalted and a
more enduring sentiment than that which bears it name. I have done. I am
not eloquent: I can say no more, than that I deeply and sincerely love
you."
</p>
<p>
This, perhaps, will be regarded by connoisseurs as tolerably pathetic, and
for the kind of thing not very ridiculous. Now, let A. S. S. be the lover:
and let us have his version of the same story:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Mary, my capital in life is invested in you. You need not stick at giving
me credit; my heart is as safe as the bank. The sum total of my love for
you defies calculation. Nor is my attachment anything in the common way.
It is a superior and more durable article than that in general wear. My
stock of words is exhausted. I am no wholesale dealer in that line. All I
can say is, that I have a vast fund of unadulterated affection for you."
</p>
<p>
In this effusion the Stock Exchange, the multiplication table, and the dry
goods and grocer's shops have been drawn upon for a clothing to the
suitor's ideas; and by an unhappy choice of words, the most delightful and
amiable feelings of our nature, without which life would be a desert and
man a bear, are invested with a ridiculous disguise.
</p>
<p>
We would willingly enlarge upon the topic which we have <span
class="pagenum"><a name="link072" id="link072"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p072.jpg">072</a></span>thus slightly handled,
but that we feel that we should by so doing, intrench too far on the
boundaries of Rhetoric, to which science, more particularly than to
Grammar, the consideration of Metaphor belongs; besides which, it is high
time to have done with Etymology.

<p>
A <span class="pagenum"><a name="link073" id="link073"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p073.jpg">073</a></span>sentence is an
aggregate of words forming a complete sense.
</p>
<p>
Sentences are of two kinds, simple and compound. A simple sentence has in
it but one subject and one finite verb; that is, a verb to which number
and person belong: as, "A joke is a joke."
</p>
<p>
A compound sentence consists of two or more simple sentences connected
together: as, "A joke is a joke, but a ducking is no joke. Corpulence is
the attribute of swine, mayors, and oxen."
</p>
<p>
Simple sentences may be divided (if we choose to take the trouble) into
the Explicative or explaining; the Interrogative, or asking; the
imperative, or commanding.
</p>
<p>
An explicative sentence is, in other words, a direct assertion: as, "Sir,
you are impertinent."&mdash;<i>Johnson</i>.
</p>
<p>
An interrogative sentence "merely asks a question:" as, "Are you a
policeman? How's your Inspector?" An imperative sentence is expressive of
command, exhortation, or entreaty; as, "Shoulder arms!"
</p>
<p>
"Turn out your toes!"
</p>
<p>
"Charge bayonets!"
</p>
<p>
A phrase is two or more words properly put together, making either a
sentence or part of a sentence: as, "Good morning!"
</p>
<p>
"Your most obedient!"
</p>
<p>
Some phrases consist of two or more words improperly put together: these
are improper phrases: as, "Now then, old stupid!"
</p>
<p>
"Stand out of the sunshine!" Other phrases consist of words put together
by ladies: as, "A duck of a man," "A love of a shawl," "so nice," "quite
refreshing," "sweetly pretty." "Did you ever?" "No I never!"

<h4>
<a href="images/083.jpg"><i>Original Size</i></a>

<p>
Other phrases again consist of French and English words put together by
people of quality, because their knowledge <span class="pagenum"><a
name="link074" id="link074"></a><a href="../44802-page-images/p074.jpg">074</a></span>of
both languages is pretty nearly equal: as, "I am au désespoir,"
</p>
<p>
"mis hors de combat,"
</p>
<p>
"quite ennuyé," or rather in nine cases out of ten, "ennuyeé,"&mdash;"I
have a great envié" to do so and so. These constitute an important variety
of comic English.
</p>
<p>
If you want to know what subjects and objects are, you should go to the
Morgue at Paris. But in Grammar&mdash;
</p>
<p>
The subject is the thing chiefly spoken of; the attribute is that which is
affirmed or denied of it; and the object is the thing affected by such
action.
</p>
<p>
The <span class="pagenum"><a name="link075" id="link075"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p075.jpg">075</a></span>nominative denotes the
subject, and usually goes before the verb or attribute; and the word or
phrase, denoting the object, follows the verb; as, "The flirt torments her
lover." Here, a flirt is the subject; torments, the attribute or thing
affirmed; and her lover, the object.

(which the flirt does not, for she is all body and no soul) Concord and
Government.
</p>

Concord is the agreement which one word has with another, in gender,
number, case or person.

<p>
Note.&mdash;That a want of agreement between words does not invalidate <i>deeds</i>.
We apprehend that such an engagement as the following, properly
authenticated, would hold good in law.

part of speech has over another, in directing its mood, tense, or case.

Government is also that power, of which, if the Agrarians have their way,
we shall soon see very little in this country.

<p>
To produce the agreement and right disposition of words in a sentence, the
following rules (and observations?) should be carefully studied.
</p>
<h3>
RULE I.
</h3>
<p>
A verb must agree with its nominative case in number and person: as "I
perceive."
</p>
<p>
"Thou hast been to Boston."
</p>
<p>
"Apes chatter."
</p>
<p>
"Frenchmen gabble."
</p>
<p>
Certain liberties are sometimes taken with this rule: as, "I own I likes
good beer."
</p>
<p>
"You'm a fine fellow, aint yer?" Such modes of speaking are adopted by
those who neither know nor care anything about grammatical correctness:
but there are other persons who care a great deal about it, but
unfortunately do not know what it consists in. Such folks are very fond of
saying, "How it rain!"
</p>
<p>
"It fit you very well."
</p>
<p>
"He say he think it very unbecoming."
</p>
<p>
"I were gone before you <span class="pagenum"><a name="link078"
id="link078"></a><a href="../44802-page-images/p078.jpg">078</a></span>was
come," and so forth, in which forms of speech they perceive a peculiar
elegance.
</p>
<p>
The infinitive mood, or part of a sentence, is sometimes used as the
nominative case to the verb: as, "to be good is to be happy which is as
grammatical an assertion as "Toby Good is Toby Happy;" and rather
surpasses it in respect of sense. "That two pippins are a pair, is a
proposition which no man in his senses will deny."
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
"To be a connoisseur in boots,
To hate all rational pursuits,
To make your money fly, as though
Gold would as fast as mushrooms grow;
To haunt the Opera, save whene'er
There's anything worth hearing there;
To smirk, to smile, to bow, to dance,
To talk of what they eat in France,
To languish, simper, sue, and sigh,
And stuff her bead with flattery;
Are means to gain that worthless part,
A fashionable lady's heart."
</pre>
<p>
Here are examples enough, in all conscience, of infinitive moods serving
as nominative oases.
</p>
<p>
All verbs, save only in the infinitive mood or participle, require a
nominative case either expressed or understood: as, "Row with me down the
river," that is "Row thou, or do thou row."
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
"Come where the aspens quiver,"
"come thou, or do thou come."
"Fly not yet;"
"fly not thou, or do not thou fly."
"Pass the ruby;"
"Pass thou, or do thou pass the ruby" (not the Rubicon.
</pre>
<p>
A <span class="pagenum"><a name="link079" id="link079"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p079.jpg">079</a></span>well known popular song
affords an example of the violation of this rule.
</p>
<p>
"Ven as the Captain comed for to hear on't, Wery much applauded vot she'd
done."
</p>
<p>

</div>
<h4>
<a href="images/088.jpg"><i>Original Size</i></a>
</h4>
<p>
The verb applauded has here no nominative case, whereas it ought to have
been governed by the pronoun he. "He very much applauded," &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
Every nominative case, except when made absolute, or used, like the Latin
Vocative, in addressing a person, should belong to some verb, implied if
not expressed. A beautiful example of this grammatical maxim, <span
class="pagenum"><a name="link080" id="link080"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p080.jpg">080</a></span>and one, too, that
explains itself, is impressed upon the mind very soon after its first
introduction to letters: as,
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
"Who kill'd Cock Robin?
I said the sparrow,
With my bow and arrow;
I kill'd Cock Robin."
</pre>
<p>
Of the neglect of this rule also, the ballad lately mentioned presents an
instance: as,
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
"Four-and-twenty brisk young fellows
Clad in jackets, blue array,&mdash;
And they took poor Billy Taylor
From his true love all avay."
</pre>
<p>
The only verb in these four lines is the verb took, which is governed by
the pronoun they. The four-and-twenty brisk young fellows, therefore,
though undeniably in the nominative, have no verb to belong to: while, at
the same time, whatever may be thought of their behavior to Mr. William
Taylor, they are certainly not absolute in point of case.
</p>
<p>
When a verb comes between two nouns, either of which may be taken as the
subject of the affirmation, it may agree with either of them: as,
"Two-and-six-pence is half-a-crown." Due regard, however, should be paid
to that noun which is most naturally the subject of the verb: it would be
clearly wrong to say, "Ducks and green peas is a delicacy."
</p>
<p>
"Fleas is a nuisance."
</p>
<p>
A nominative case, standing without a personal tense of a verb, and being
put before a participle, independently of the rest of the sentence, is
called a case absolute: as, "My brethren, to-morrow being Sunday, I shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="link081" id="link081"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p081.jpg">081</a></span>preach a sermon in John
street; after which we shall join in a hymn, and that having been sungy
Brother Biggs will address you."
</p>
<p>
The objective case is sometimes incorrectly made absolute by showmen and
others: as, "Here, gentlemen and ladies, you will see that great warrior
Napoleon Bonaparte, standing agin a tree with his hands in his breeches
pockets, him taking good care to keep out of harm's vay. And there, on the
extreme right, you will observe the Duky Vellingtdn a valking about amidst
the red-hot cannon balls, him not caring von straw."

</div>
<h4>
<a href="images/090.jpg"><i>Original Size</i></a>
</h4>
<h3>
RULE II.
</h3>
<p>
Two or more singular nouns, joined together by a copulative conjunction,
expressed, or understood are equivalent <span class="pagenum"><a
name="link082" id="link082"></a><a href="../44802-page-images/p082.jpg">082</a></span>to
a plural noun, and therefore require verbs, nouns, and pronouns, agreeing
with them in the plural number: as, "Veal, wine, and vinegar are very good
victuals I vow."
</p>
<p>
"Burke and Hare were nice men."
</p>
<p>
"A hat without a crown, a tattered coat, threadbare and out at elbows, a
pair of breeches which looked like a piece of dirty patchwork diversified
by various holes, and of boots which a Jew would hardly have raked from a
kennel, at once proclaimed him a man who had seen better days."
</p>
<p>
This rule is not always adhered to in discourse quite so closely as a
fastidious ear would require it to be: as, "And so, you know, Mary, and I,
and Jane was a dusting the chairs, and in comes Missus."
</p>
<h3>
RULE III.
</h3>
<p>
When the conjunction disjunctive comes between two nouns, the verb, noun,
or pronoun, is of the singular number, because it refers to each of such
nouns taken separately: as, "A cold in the head, or a sore eye is a great
disadvantage to a lover."
</p>
<p>
If singular pronouns, or a noun and pronoun of different persons, be
disjunctively connected, the verb must agree with the person which stands
nearest to it; as, "I or thou art."
</p>
<p>
"Thou or I am"
</p>
<p>
"I, thou, or he is" &amp;c. But as this way of writing or speaking is very
inelegant, and as saying, "Either I am, or thou art," and so on, will
always render having recourse to it unnecessary, the rule just laid down
is almost useless, except inasmuch as it suggests a moral maxim, namely,
"Always be on good terms with your next door neighbor."
</p>
<p>
It also forcibly reminds us of some beautiful lines by
</p>
<p>
Moore, <span class="pagenum"><a name="link083" id="link083"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p083.jpg">083</a></span>in which the heart,
like a tendril, is said to twine round the "nearest and loveliest thing."
Now the person which is placed nearest the verb is the object of choice;
ergo, the most agreeable person&mdash;ergo, the loveliest person or thing.
</p>
<p>
Should a conjunction disjunctive occur between a singular noun or pronoun,
and a plural one, the verb agrees with the plural noun or pronoun: as,
"Neither a king nor his courtiers are averse to butter:" (particularly
when thickly spread.) "Darius or the Persians were hostile to Greece."
</p>
<h3>
RULE IV.
</h3>
<p>
A noun or multitude, that is, one which signifies many, can have a verb or
Pronoun to agree with it either in the singular or plural number;
according to the import of such noun, as conveying unity or plurality of
idea: as, "The nations humbugged."
</p>
<p>
"The multitude have to pay many taxes."
</p>
<p>
"The city Council are at a loss to know what to do."
</p>
<p>
"The people is a many headed monster."
</p>
<h3>
RULE V.
</h3>
<p>
Pronouns agree with their antecedents, and with the nouns to which they
belong, in gender and number: as, "This is the blow which killed Ned."
</p>
<p>
"England was once governed by a celebrated King, who was called Rufus the
Red, but whose name was by no means so illustrious as that of Alfred."
</p>
<p>
"General M. and the Lieutenant had put on their boots."
</p>
<p>
"The lady appeared, and she smiled, but the smile belied her feelings."
</p>
<p>
The relative being of the same person with the antecedent, <span
class="pagenum"><a name="link084" id="link084"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p084.jpg">084</a></span>the verb always agrees
with it: as,
</p>
<p>
"Thou who learnest Syntax"
</p>
<p>
"I who enlighten thy mind."
</p>
<p>
The objective case of the personal pronouns is by some, for want of better
information, employed in the place of these and those: as,
</p>
<p>
"Let them things alone."
</p>
<p>
"Now then, Jemes, make haste with them chops." The adverb there, is
sometimes, with additional impropriety, joined to the pronoun them: as,
</p>
<p>
"Look after them there sheep."
</p>
<p>
The objective case of a pronoun in the first person is put after the
interjections Oh! and Ah! as,
</p>
<p>
"Oh! dear me," &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
The second person, however, requires a nominative case: as,
</p>
<p>
"Oh! you good-for-nothing man!"
</p>
<p>
"Ah! thou gay Lothario!"
</p>
<p>
<br /><br />

<a href="images/093.jpg"><i>Original Size</i></a>

<h3>
RULE VI.
</h3>
<p>
When <span class="pagenum"><a name="link085" id="link085"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p085.jpg">085</a></span>there is no nominative
case between the relative and the verb, the relative itself is the
nominative to the verb: as, "The master who flogged us."
</p>
<p>
"The rods which were used."
</p>
<p>
But when the nominative comes between the relative and the verb, the
relative exchanges, as it were, the character of sire for that of son, and
becomes the governed instead of the governor; depending for its case | on
some word in its own member of the sentence: as, "He who is now at the
head of affairs, whom the people delight to honor, and to whom is
intrusted the helm of state&mdash;is a Polk."
</p>
<h3>
RULE VII.
</h3>
<p>
The relative and the verb, when the former is preceded by two nominatives
of different persons, may agree in person with either, according to the
sense: as,
</p>
<p>
"I am the young gentleman who do the lovers at the Chatham;" or, "who
does."
</p>
<p>
<br /><br />

</div>
<h4>
<a href="images/095.jpg"><i>Original Size</i></a>
</h4>
<p>
Let this maxim be borne constantly in mind. "A murderer of good characters
should always be made an example of."
</p>
<h3>
RULE VIII.
</h3>
<p>
Every adjective, and every adjective pronoun, relates to a substantive,
expressed or implied: as, "Dando was an unprincipled, as well as a
voracious man."
</p>
<p>
"Few quarrel with their bread and butter;" that is, "few persons."
</p>
<p>
"This is the wonderful eagle of the sun." That is, "This eagle" &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
Adjective pronouns agree in number with their substantives: "This muff,
these muffs; that booby, these boobies; another numscull, other
numsculls."
</p>
<p>
Some <span class="pagenum"><a name="link086" id="link086"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p086.jpg">086</a></span>people say, "Those kind
of things," or, "This four-and-twenty year," neither of which expressions
they have any business to use.
</p>
<p>
Adjectives are sometimes improperly used as adverbs: as, "He behaved very
bad."
</p>
<p>
"He insulted me most gross."
</p>
<p>
"He eat and drank uncommon."
</p>
<p>
"He wur beat very severe."
</p>
<p>
"It hailed tremendous" or, more commonly, "tremenjus."
</p>
<h3>
RULE IX.
</h3>
<p>
The article a or an agrees with nouns in the singular number only: as, "A
fool, an ass, a simpleton, a ninny, <span class="pagenum"><a name="link087"
id="link087"></a><a href="../44802-page-images/p087.jpg">087</a></span>a
lout&mdash;I would not give a farthing for a thousand such."
</p>
<p>
The definite article the may agree with nouns in the singular and plural
number: as, "The toast, the ladies, the ducks."
</p>
<p>
The articles are often properly omitted; when used, they serve to
determine or limit the thing spoken of: as, "Variety is charming."
</p>
<p>
"Familiarity doth breed contempt."
</p>
<p>
"A stitch in time saves nine."
</p>
<p>
"The heart that has truly loved never forgets."
</p>
<h3>
RULE X.
</h3>
<p>
One substantive, in the possessive or genitive case, is governed by
another, of a different meaning: as, "A fiddle-stick's end."
</p>
<p>
"Monkey's allowance."
</p>
<p>
"Virtue's reward."
</p>
<p>
<br /><br />

</div>
<h4>
<a href="images/096.jpg"><i>Original Size</i></a>
</h4>
<h3>
RULE XI.
</h3>
<p>
Active verbs govern the objective case: as, "I kissed her."
</p>
<p>
"She scratched me"
</p>
<p>
"Virtue rewards her followers."
</p>
<p>
For <span class="pagenum"><a name="link088" id="link088"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p088.jpg">088</a></span>which reason she is
like a cook.
</p>
<p>
Verbs neuter do not govern an objective case. Observe, therefore, that
such phrases: as,
</p>
<p>
"She cried a good one,"
</p>
<p>
"He came the old soldier over me,"
</p>
<p>
and so forth, are highly improper in a grammatical point of view, to say
nothing of other objections to them.
</p>
<p>
These verbs, however, are capable of governing words of a meaning similar
to their own: as, in the affecting ballad of Giles Scroggins&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"I wont, she cried, and screamed a scream"
</p>
<p>
The verb To Be has the same case after it as that which goes before it:
as, "It was I" not "It was me"
</p>
<p>
"The Grubbs were they who eat so much tripe at our last party not "The
Grubbses were them."
</p>
<h3>
RULE XII.
</h3>
<p>
One verb governs another that depends upon it, in the infinitive mood: as,
"Cease to smoke pipes."
</p>
<p>
"Begin to wear collars."
</p>
<p>
"I advise you to shave"
</p>
<p>
"I recommend you to go to church."
</p>
<p>
"I resolved to visit the Carolinas."
</p>
<p>
"And there I learned to wheel about And jump Jim Crow."
</p>
<p>
In general the preposition to is used before the latter of two verbs; but
sometimes it is more properly omitted: as, "I saw you take it, young
fellow; come along with me."
</p>
<p>
"Let me get hold of you, that's all!"
</p>
<p>
"Did I hear you speak?"
</p>
<p>
"I'll let you know!"
</p>
<p>
"You dare not hit me."
</p>
<p>
"Bid me discourse"
</p>
<p>
"You need not sing"
</p>
<p>
The proposition for is sometimes unnecessarily intruded into a sentence,
in addition to the preposition to, before an infinitive mood: as, How came
you for to think, <span class="pagenum"><a name="link089" id="link089"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p089.jpg">089</a></span>for to go, for to do
such a thing?" Do you want me for to punch your head?"
</p>
<p>
Adjectives, substantives, and participles, often govern the infinitive
mood: as, "Miss Hopkins, I shall be happy to dance the next set with you."
</p>
<p>
"Oh! Sir, it is impossible to refuse you."
</p>
<p>
"Have you an inclination to waltz?"
</p>
<p>
"I shall be delighted in endeavoring to do so."
</p>
<p>
The infinitive mood is frequently made absolute, that is, independent of
the rest of the sentence: as, "To say the truth, I was rather the worse
for liquor."
</p>
<p>
"Not to mince matters, Miss, I love you."
</p>
<p>

RULE XIII.
</h3>
<p>
The <span class="pagenum"><a name="link090" id="link090"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p090.jpg">090</a></span>relation which words
and phrases bear to each other in point of time, should always be duly
marked: instead of saying, "Last night I intended to have made strong love
to her," we should say, "Last night I intended to make strong love to
her;" because, although the intention of making strong love may have been
abandoned (on reflection) this morning, and is now, therefore, a thing
which is past, yet it is undoubtedly, when last night and the thoughts
connected with it are brought back, again present to the mind.
</p>
<h3>
RULE XIV.
</h3>
<p>
Participles have the same power of government with that of the verbs from
which they are derived: as,
</p>
<p>
"Oh, what an exquisite singer Rubini is! I am so fond of hearing him."
</p>
<p>
"Look at that horrid man; I declare he is quizzing us!"
</p>
<p>
"No, he is only taking snuff."
</p>
<p>
"See, how that thing opposite keeps making mouths."
</p>
<p>
"How fond they all are of wearing mustaches! Don't you like it?"
</p>
<p>
"Oh, yes! there is no resisting them."
</p>
<p>
"Heigho! I am dying to have an ice&mdash;"
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Young man for a husband, Miss?
For shame, Sir! don't be rude!
</pre>
<p>
Participles are sometimes used as substantives: as, "The French mouth is
adapted to the making of grimaces."
</p>
<p>
"The cobbler is like the parson; he lives by the mending of soles."
</p>
<p>
"The tailor reaps a good harvest from the sewing of cloth."
</p>
<p>
"Did you ever see a shoot-ing of the moon?"
</p>
<p>
Is this what the witches mean when they sing, in the acting play of
Macbeth,
</p>
<p>
"We fly by night?"
</p>
<p>
If <span class="pagenum"><a name="link091" id="link091"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p091.jpg">091</a></span>they "shoot the moon,"
they are shooting stars. There is a mode of using the indefinite article a
before a participle, for which there is no occasion, as it does not
convert the participle into a substantive, and makes no alteration in the
sense of what is said; in this case the article, therefore, is like a
wart, a wen, or a knob at the end of the nose, neither useful nor
ornamental: as, "Going out a shooting."
</p>
<p>
"Are you a coming to-morrow?"
</p>
<p>
"I was a thinking about what Jem said."
</p>
<p>
"Here you are, a going of it, as usual!" A liberty not unfrequently taken
with the English Language, is the substitution of the perfect participle
for the imperfect tense, and of the imperfect tense for the perfect
participle: as, "He run like mad, with the great dog after him."
</p>
<p>
"Maria come and told us all about it."
</p>
<p>
"When I had wrote the Valentine, I sealed it with my thimble."
</p>
<p>
"He has rose to (be) a common* councilman."
</p>
<p>
"I was chose Lord Mayor."
</p>
<p>
"I've eat (or a eat) lots of vension in my time."
</p>
<p>
"I should have spoke if you hadn't put in your oar."
</p>
<p>
"You were mistook."
</p>
<p>
"He sent her an affecting copy of verses, which was wrote with a Perryian
pen."
</p>
<h3>
RULE XV.
</h3>
<p>
Adverbs are generally placed in a sentence before adjectives, after verbs
active or neuter, and frequently between the auxiliary and the verb: as,
"He came, Sir, and he was most exceedingly drunk; he could hardly stand
upon his legs; he made a very lame discourse; he spoke incoherently and
ridiculously; and was impatiently heard by the whole assembly."
</p>
<p>
"He is fashionably dressed."
</p>
<p>
"She is conspicuously ugly."
</p>
<p>
"The eye of <span class="pagenum"><a name="link092" id="link092"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p092.jpg">092</a></span>jealousy is
proverbially sharp, and yet it is indisputiably green"
</p>
<p>
"The French Marquis was a very charming man; he danced exquisitely and
nimbly, and was greatly admired by all the ladies."
</p>

<p>
Several adverbs have been coined of late; and some of them are very
remarkable for a "particular" elegance: as, "I reckon you're catawampously
chawed up." In the example just given there is to be found, besides the
new adverb, a word which, if not also new to the <span class="pagenum"><a
name="link093" id="link093"></a><a href="../44802-page-images/p093.jpg">093</a></span>English
student, is rendered so both by its orthography and pronunciation; namely,
<i>chawed</i>. This term is no other than "chewed," modified. "Chawed up"
is a very strong expression, and is employed to signify the most complete
state of discomfiture and defeat, when a man is as much crushed, mashed,
and comminuted, morally speaking, as if he had literally and corporeally
undergone the process of mastication. "Catawampously" is a concentration
of "hopelessly," "tremendously," "thoroughly," and "irrevocably;" so that
"catawampously chawed up," means, brought as nearly to a state of utter
annihilation as anything consistently with the laws of nature can possibly
be. For the metaphorical use of the word "chawed," three several reasons
have been given: 1. Familiarity with the manner in which the alligator
disposes of his vie-tims. 2. The cannibalism of the Aborigines. 3. The
delicate practice of chewing tobacco. Each of these is supported by
numerous arguments, on the consideration of which it would be quite out of
the question to enter in this place.
</p>
<h3>
RULE XVI.
</h3>
<p>
Two English negatives (like French lovers) destroy one another,&mdash;and
become equivalent to an affirmative: as, "The question before the House
was not an unimportant one;" that is, "it was an important one."
</p>
<p>
"Mr. Brown was free to confess that he did not undertake to say that he
would not on some future occasion give a satisfactory answer to the
honorable gentleman."
</p>
<p>
Thus, at one and the same time, we teach our readers Syntax and
secretiveness.
</p>
<p>
It is probable that small boys are often unacquainted with <span
class="pagenum"><a name="link094" id="link094"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p094.jpg">094</a></span>this rule; for many of
them, while undergoing personal chastisement, exclaim, for the purpose, as
it would appear, of causing its duration to be shortened&mdash;"Oh pray,
Sir, oh pray, Sir, oh pray, Sir! I won't do so no more!"
</p>
<h3>
RULE XVII.
</h3>
<p>
Prepositions govern the objective case: as, "What did the butcher say of
her?"
</p>
<p>
"He said that she would never do for him; that she was too thin for a
wife, and he was not fond of a spare rib."
</p>
<p>
The delicate ear is much offended by any deviation from this rule: as, in
a shocking and vulgar song which it was once our misfortune to hear:&mdash;
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
"There I found the faithless she
Frying sausages for he."
</pre>
<p>
We had occasion, in the Etymology, to remark on a certain misuse of the
preposition, of. This, perhaps, is best explained by stating that of in
the instances cited, is made to usurp the government of cases which are
already under a rightful jurisdiction: as, "What are you got a eating of?"
</p>
<p>
"He had been a beating of his wife."
</p>
<h3>
RULE XVIII.
</h3>
<p>
Conjunctions connect similar moods and tenses of verbs, and cases of nouns
and pronouns: as, "A coat of arms suspended on a wall is like an executed
traitor; it is hanged, drawn, and quartered."
</p>
<p>
"If you continue thus to drink brandy and water and to smoke cigars, you
will be like Boreas the North wind, who takes 'cold without' wherever he
goes, and always 'blows a cloud' when it comes in his way."
</p>
<p>
"Do you think there is any <span class="pagenum"><a name="link095"
id="link095"></a><a href="../44802-page-images/p095.jpg">095</a></span>thing
between him and her?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes; he, and she are engaged ones."

<p>
Note.&mdash;To ask whether there is any thing between two persons of
opposite sexes, is one way of inquiring whether they are in love with each
other. It is not, however, in our opinion, a very happy phrase, inasmuch
as whatever intervenes between a couple of fond hearts, must tend to
prevent them from coming together.
</p>
<h3>
RULE XIX.
</h3>
<p>
Some conjunctions govern the indicative; some the subjunctive mood. In
general, it is right to use the subjunctive, <span class="pagenum"><a
name="link096" id="link096"></a><a href="../44802-page-images/p096.jpg">096</a></span>when
contingency or doubt is implied: as, "If I were to say that the moon is
made of green cheese."
</p>
<p>
"If I were a wiseacre."
</p>
<p>
"If I were a Wilt-shire-man."
</p>
<p>
"A lady, unless, she be toasted, is never drunk."
</p>
<p>
And when she is toasted, those who are drunk are generally the gentlemen.
</p>
<p>

</div>
<h4>
<a href="images/105.jpg"><i>Original Size</i></a>
</h4>
<p>
Those conjunctions which have a positive and absolute signification,
require the indicative mood: as, "He who fasts may be compared to a horse:
for as the animal eats not a bit, so neither does the man partake of a
morsel."
</p>
<p>
"The rustic is deluded by false hopes, for his daily food is gammon."
</p>
<p>
Every philosopher has his weak points, and in the Sylva Sylvarum may be
found some gammon of Bacon.
</p>
<h3>
RULE XX.
</h3>
<p>
When a comparison is made between two or more things, the latter noun or
pronoun is not governed by the <span class="pagenum"><a name="link097"
id="link097"></a><a href="../44802-page-images/p097.jpg">097</a></span>conjunction
than or as, but agrees with the verb, or is governed by the verb or
preposition, expressed or understood: as, "The French are a lighter people
than we," (that is "than we are,") "and yet we are not so dark as they,"
that is, "as they are."
</p>
<p>
"I should think that they admire me more than them," that is, "than they
admire them."
</p>
<p>
"It is a shame, Martha! you were thinking more of that young officer than
me," that is, "of me."
</p>
<p>
<br /><br />

</div>
<h4>
<a href="images/106.jpg"><i>Original Size</i></a>
</h4>
<p>
Sufficient attention is not always paid, in discourse, to this rule. Thus,
a schoolboy may be often heard to exclaim,
</p>
<p>
"What did you hit me for, you great fool?"
</p>
<p>
"You're bigger than me. Hit some one of your own size!"
</p>
<p>
"Not fling farther than him? just can't I, that's all!"
</p>
<p>
"You and I have got more marbles than them,"
</p>
<h3>
RULE XXI.
</h3>
<p>
An <span class="pagenum"><a name="link098" id="link098"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p098.jpg">098</a></span>ellipsis, or omission
of certain words, is frequently allowed, for the sake of avoiding
disagreeable repetitions, and of expressing our ideas in a few words.
Instead of saying, "She was a little woman, she was a round woman, and she
was an old woman," we say, making use of the figure Ellipsis, "She was a
little, round, and old woman."
</p>
<p>
When, however, the omission of words is productive of obscurity, weakens
the sentence, or involves a violation of some grammatical principle, the
ellipsis must not be used. It is improper to say, "Puddings fill who fill
them;" we should supply the word those. "A beautiful leg of mutton and
turnips" is not good language: those who would deserve what they are
talking about ought to say, "A beautiful leg of mutton and fine turnips."
</p>
<p>
In common discourse, in which the meaning can be eked out by gestures,
signs, and inarticulate sounds variously modified, the ellipsis is much
more liberally and more extensively employed than in written composition.
"May I have the pleasure of&mdash;hum? ha?" may constitute an invitation
to take wine. "I shall be quite&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;" may serve as an
answer in the affirmative. "So then you see he was&mdash;eh!&mdash;you see&mdash;,"
is perhaps an intimation that a man has been hanged. "Well, of all the&mdash;I
never!" is often tantamount to three times as many words expressive of
surprise, approbation, or disapprobation, according to the tone in which
it is uttered. "Will you?&mdash;ah!&mdash;will you?&mdash;ah!&mdash;ah!&mdash;ah!"
will do either for "Will you be so impertinent, you scoundrel? will you
dare to do so another <span class="pagenum"><a name="link099" id="link099"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p099.jpg">099</a></span>time?" or, "Will you,
dearest, loveliest, most adorable of your sex, will you consent to make me
happy; will you be mine? speak! answer, I entreat you! One word from those
sweet lips will make me the most fortunate man in existence!"
</p>
<p>
There is, however, a kind of ellipsis which those who indulge in that
style of epistolary writing, wherein sentiments of a tender nature are
conveyed, will do well to avoid with the greatest care. The ellipsis
alluded to, is that of the first person singular of the personal pronoun,
as instanced in the following model of a billet-doux:&mdash;
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Camberwell,

April 1, 1844.

MY DEAREST FANNY,

Have not enjoyed the balm of sleep all the livelong night.
Encountered, last night, at the ball, the beau ideal of my
heart. Never knew what love was till then. Derided the
sentiment often; jested at scars, because had never felt a
wound. Feel at last the power of beauty&mdash;Write with a
tremulous hand; waver between hope and fear. Hope to be
thought not altogether unworthy of regard: fear to be
rejected as having no pretensions to the affections of such
unparalleled loveliness. Know not in what terms to declare
my feelings. Adore you, worship you, dote on you, am wrapt
up in you! think but on you, live but for you, would
willingly die for you!&mdash;in short, love you! and imploring
you to have some compassion on one who is distracted for
your sake

Remain

Devotedly yours

T. Tout.
</pre>
<h3>
RULE XXII.
</h3>
<p>
A <span class="pagenum"><a name="link100" id="link100"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p100.jpg">100</a></span>Regular and dependent
construction should be carefully preserved throughout the whole of a
sentence, and all its parts should correspond to each other. There is,
therefore, an inaccuracy in the following sentence; "Greenacre was more
admired, but not so much lamented, as Burke." It should be, "Greenacre was
more admired than Burke, but not so much lamented."
</p>
<p>
Of these two worthies there will be a notice of the following kind in a
biographical dictionary, to be published a thousand years hence in
America.
</p>
<p>
Greenacre.&mdash;A celebrated critic who so cut up a blue-stocking lady of
the name of Brown, that he did not leave her a leg to stand upon.
</p>
<p>
Burke.&mdash;A famous orator, whose power of stopping people's mouths was
said to be prodigious. It is farther reported of him that he was only once
hung up, and that on the occasion of the last speech he ever made.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps it may be said that the rule last stated comprehends all preceding
rules and requires exemplification accordingly. We therefore call the
attention of the reader to the following paragraph, requesting him to
consider what, and how many, violations of the maxims of Syntax it
contains.
</p>
<p>
"We teaches, that is, my son and me teaches, the boys English Grammar. Tom
or Dick have learned something every day but Harry what is idler, whom I
am sure will never come to no good, for he is always a miching and doing
those kind of things (he was catch but yesterday in a skittle grounds) he
only makes his book all dog's ears. I beat he, too, pretty smartish, as I
ought, you will say, for to have did. I was going to have <span
class="pagenum"><a name="link101" id="link101"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p101.jpg">101</a></span>sent him away last week
but he somehow got over me as he do always. I have had so much trouble
with he, that between you and I, if I was not paid for il, I wouldn't have
no more to do with such a boy. There never wasn't a monkey more
mischievious than him; and a donkey isn't more stupider and not half so
obstinate as that youngster."
</p>
<p>
The Syntax of the Interjection has been sufficiently stated under Rule V.
Interjections afford more matter for consideration in a Treatise on
Elocution than they do in a work on Grammar; but there is one observation
which we are desirous of making respecting them, and which will not, it is
hoped, be thought altogether foreign to our present subject. Almost every
interjection has a great variety of meanings, adapted to particular
occasions and circumstances, and indicated chiefly by the tone of the
voice. Of this proposition we shall now give a few illustrations, which we
would endeavor to render still clearer by the addition of musical notes,
but that these would hardly express, with adequate exactness, the
modulations of sound to which we allude; and besides, we hope to be
sufficiently understood without such help. This part of the Grammar should
be read aloud by the student; or, which is better still, the interjection,
where it is possible, should be repeated with the proper intonation by a
class; the sentence which gives occasion to it being read by the
preceptor. We will select the interjection Oh! as the source from which
our examples are to be drawn.
</p>
<p>
"I'll give it to you, you idle dog: I will!"
</p>
<p>
"Oh, pray, Sir! Oh, pray, Sir! Oh! Oh! Oh!"
</p>
<p>
"I shall ever have the highest esteem for you, Sir; but as to love, that
is out of the question."
</p>
<p>
"Oh, <span class="pagenum"><a name="link102" id="link102"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p102.jpg">102</a></span>Matilda!"
</p>
<p>
"I say, Jim, look at that chaffinch: there's a shy!"
</p>
<p>
"Oh, Crikey!"
</p>
<p>
"Miss Timms, do you admire Lord Byron?"
</p>
<p>
"Oh, yes!"
</p>
<p>
"What do you think of Rubini's singing?"
</p>
<p>
"Oh!"
</p>
<p>
"So then, you see, we popped round the corner, and caught them just in the
nick of time."
</p>
<p>
"Oh!"
</p>
<p>
"Sir, your behavior has done you great credit."
</p>
<p>
"Oh!"
</p>
<p>
"Oats are looking up."
</p>
<p>
"Oh!"
</p>
<p>
"Honorable Members might say what they pleased; but he was convinced, for
his part, that the New Poor Law had given great general satisfaction."
</p>
<p>
"Oh! oh!"
</p>
<p>
There being now no reason (or rule) to detain us in the Syntax, we shall
forthwith advance into Prosody, where we shall have something to say, not
only about rules, but also of measures.

<p>
Accent <span class="pagenum"><a name="link104" id="link104"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p104.jpg">104</a></span>is the marking with a
peculiar stress of the voice a particular letter or syllable in a word, in
such a manner as to render it more distinct or audible than the rest.
Thus, in the word théatre, the stress of the voice should be on the letter
e and first syllable the; and in contrary, on the first syllable con. How
shocking it is to hear people say con-trary, the-atre! The friends of
education will be reminded with regret, that an error in the pronunciation
of the first of these words is very early impressed on the human mind.
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
"Mary, Mary,
Quite contrary,
How does your garden grow?"

<p>
How many evils, alas! arise from juvenile associations!
</p>
<p>
Words of two syllables never have more than one of them accented, except
for the sake of peculiar emphasis. Gentlemen, however, whose profession it
is to drive certain public vehicles called cabs, are much accustomed to
disregard this rule, and to say, "po-lite" (or "pur-lite"), "gén-téel,"
"con-cern," "po-lice," and so on: nay, they go so far as to convert a word
of one syllable into two, for the sake of indulging in this style of
pronunciation; and thus the word "queer" is pronounced by them as
"ke-veer."
</p>
<p>
The word "a-men," when standing alone, should be pronounced with two
accents.
</p>
<p>
The accents in which it usually is pronounced are very inelegant. Clerks,
now-a-days, alas! are no scholars.
</p>
<p>
Dissyllables, formed by adding a termination, usually have the former
syllable accented: as, "Foolish, block-head," &amp;c.

formed by prefixing a syllable to the radical word, is commonly on the
latter syllable: as, "I protest, I declare, I entreat, I adore, I expire."
</p>
<p>
Protestations, declarations, entreaties, and adorations, proclaim a swain
to be simply tender; but expiration (for love) proves him to be decidedly
soft.

A man who turns lover becomes a protest-ant; and his conduct at the same
time generally undergoes a reformation, especially if he has previously
been a rake.
</p>
<p>
The zeal, however, of a reformed rake, like that of Jack in Dean Swift's
"Tale of a Tub," is sometimes apt to outrun his discretion.
</p>
<p>
When the same word, being a dissyllable, is both a noun <span
class="pagenum"><a name="link106" id="link106"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p106.jpg">106</a></span>and a verb, the verb
has mostly the accent on the latter, and the noun on the former Syllable:
as,
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
"Molly, let Hymen's gentle hand
Cemént our hearts together,
With such a cément as shall stand
In spite of wind and weather.

"I do presage&mdash;and oft a fact
A présage doth foretoken&mdash;
Our mutual love shall ne'er contract,
Our côntract ne'er be broken."
</pre>
<p>
There are many exceptions to the rule just enunciated (so that, correctly
as well as familiarly speaking, it is perhaps <i>no</i> rule;) for though
verbs seldom have an accent on the former, yet nouns frequently have it on
the latter syllable: as,
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
"Mary Anne is my delight
Both by day and eke by night;
For by day her soft contrôl
Soothes my heart and calms my soul;
And her image while I doze
Comes to sweeten my repôse;
Fortune favoring my design,
Please the pigs she shall be mine!"
</pre>
<p>
The former syllable of most dissyllables ending in y, our, ow, le, ish,
ck, ter, age, en, èt, is accented: as "Grânny, noôdle," &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
Except allôw, avôw, endôw, bestôw, belôw.
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">

<p>
"Music," <span class="pagenum"><a name="link107" id="link107"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p107.jpg">107</a></span>in the language of the
Gods, is sometimes pronounced "mû-sic!"
</p>
<p>
Nouns of two syllables ending in er, have the accent on the former
syllable: as, "Bûtcher, bâker."
</p>
<p>
It is, perhaps, a singular thing, that persons who pursue the callings
denoted by the two words selected as examples, should always indicate
their presence at an area by crying out, in direct defiance of Prosody,
"But-chér, ba-kér;" the latter syllable being of the two the more strongly
accented.
</p>
<p>
Dissyllabic verbs ending in a consonant and e final, as "Disclose,"
"repine," or having a dipthong in the last syllable, as, "Believe,"
"deceive," or ending in two consonants, as "Intend," are accented on the
latter syllable.
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
"Matilda's eyes a light disclôse,
Which with the star of Eve might vie;
Oh! that such lovely orbs as those
Should sparkle at an apple-pie!

having a dipthong in the latter syllable, have the aécent also on that
syllable: as,
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
"A Hamlet that draws
Is sure of applâuse."
</pre>
<p>
A Hamlet that draws? There are not many who can give even an outline of
the character.
</p>
<p>
In a few words ending in <i>ain</i> the accent is placed on the former
syllable: as, "Villain," which is pronounced as the natives of Whitechapel
pronounce "willing." Those dissyllables, the vowels of which are separated
in pronunciation, always have the accent on the first syllable: as, lion,
scion, &amp;c.
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
When is a young and tender shoot
Like a fond swain? When 'tis a scion.

What's the most gentlemanly brute
Like, of all flow'rs? A <i>dandy</i>lion.'
</pre>
<p>
Trisyllables, formed by adding a termination or prefixing a syllable,
retain the accent of the radical word: as, "Lôveliness, shéepishness,
knâvery, assûrance." The first syllable of trisyllables ending in ons, al,
ion, is accented in the generality of cases: as in the words "sérious,
câpital," &amp;c.

That he reckoned a punster a villain:

Of a man who makes jokes that are killing?"

Trisyllables <span class="pagenum"><a name="link109" id="link109"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p109.jpg">109</a></span>ending in ce, ent, ate,
y, re, le, and ude, commonly accent the first syllable. Many of those,
however, which are derived from words having the accent on the last
syllable and of those of which the middle syllable has a vowel between two
consonants, are excepted.
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
They who would elegantly speak
Should not say "impudence," but "cheek;"
Should all things éatable call "prog;"
Eyes "ogles," côuntenance "phisog."
A coach should nôminate a "drag,"
And spécify as "moke," a nag:
For éxcellent, use "prime" or "bang up,"
Or "out and out;" and "scrag," for hang up.
The théâtre was wont to teach
The public réctitude of speech,
But we who live in modern age
Consult the gallery, not the stage.
</pre>
<p>
Trisyllables ending in ator have the accent placed on the middle syllable;
as, "Spectâtor, narrâtor," &amp;c. except ôrator, sénator, and a few other
words.
</p>
<p>
Take care that you never pronounce the common name of the vegetable
sometimes called Irish fruit, "purtator."
</p>
<p>
A dipthong in the middle syllable of a trisyllable is accented: as also,
in general, is a vowel before two consonants: as, "Doméstic," "endéavor."
</p>
<p>
An endeavor to appear domesticated, or in common phraseology, to "do" the
domestic, is sometimes made by young gentlemen, and generally with but an
ill grace. <span class="pagenum"><a name="link110" id="link110"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p110.jpg">110</a></span>Avoid such attempts,
reader, on all occasions: and in particular never adventure either to
nurse babies, or (when you shall have "gone up to the ladies") to pour
water into the tea-pot from the kettle. A legal or medical student
sometimes thinks proper, from a desire of appearing at once gallant and
facetious, to usurp the office of pouring out the tea itself, on which
occasions he is very apt to betray his uncivilised habits by an
unconscious but very unequivocal manipulation used in giving malt liquor
what is technically termed a "head."
</p>
<p>
Many polysyllables are regulated as to accent by the words from which they
are derived: as, "Inex-préssibles, Sûbstituted, Unobjéctionably,
Désignated, Transatlàntic, Délicacy, Decidedly, Unquéstionable."
</p>
<p>
Words ending in ator are commonly accented on the last syllable but one,
let them be as long as they may: as, respirâtor, regulator, renovâtor,
indicâtor, and all the other alors that we see in the newspapers.
</p>
<p>
Many words ending in ion, ous, ty, ia, io, and cal, have their accent on
the last syllable but two: as, "Con-si-de-râ-ti-on, pro-di-gi-ous,
im-pe-ne-tra-bil-i-ty, en-cy-clo-pæ'-di-a, brag-ga-dô-ci-o,
an-ti-mo-nârch-i-cal," all of which words we have divided into syllables,
by way of a hint that they are to be pronounced (comically speaking) after
the manner of Dominie Sampson.
</p>
<p>
Words that end in le usually have the accent on the first syllable: as,
"Amicable, déspicable," &amp;c.: although we have heard people say
"despicable."
</p>
<p>
"I never see such a despicable fellow, not in all my born days."
</p>
<p>
Words of this class, however, the second syllable of which has a vowel
before two consonants, are often differently <span class="pagenum"><a
name="link111" id="link111"></a><a href="../44802-page-images/p111.jpg">111</a></span>accented:
as in "Respéctable, contémptible.

Having, in compliance with grammatical usage, laid down certain rules with
regard to accent, we have to inform the reader that there are so many
exceptions to almost all of them, that perhaps there is scarcely one which
it is worth while to attend to. We hope we have some measure amused him;
but as to instruction, fear that, in this part of our subject, we have
given him <span class="pagenum"><a name="link112" id="link112"></a><a

Those who would acquire a correct accent had better attend particularly to
the mode of speaking adopted in good society; avoid debating clubs; and go
to church. For farther satisfaction and information we refer them, and we
beg to say that we are not joking&mdash;to <i>Walker</i>.

<h2>
SECTION II. OF QUANTITY.
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he quantity of a syllable means the time taken up in pronouncing it. As
there is in Arithmetic a long division and a short division, so in Prosody
is Quantity considered as long or short.
</p>
<p>
A syllable is said to be long, when the accent is on the vowel, causing it
to be slowly joined in pronunciation to the next letter: as, "Flea, small,
creature."
</p>
<p>
A syllable is called short, when the accent lies on the consonant, so that
the vowel is quickly joined to the succeeding letter: as "Crack, little,
devil."
</p>
<p>
The pronunciation of a long syllable commonly occupies double the time of
a short one: thus, "Pâte," and "Broke," must be pronounced as slowly again
as "Pàt," and "Knôck."
</p>
<p>
We have remarked a curious tendency in the more youthful students of
Grammar to regard the quantity of words (in their lessons) more as being
"small" or "great" than as coming under the head of "long" or "short."
Their predilection for small quantities of words is very striking and
peculiar; food for the mind they seem to look upon as physic; and all
physic, in their estimation, is most agreeably taken in infinitesimal
doses. The Homoeopathic system of acquiring knowledge <span class="pagenum"><a
name="link113" id="link113"></a><a href="../44802-page-images/p113.jpg">113</a></span>is
more to their taste than even the Hamiltonian.
</p>
<p>
It is quite impossible to give any rules as to quantity worth reading. The
Romans may have submitted to them, but that is no reason why we should. We
will pronounce our words as we please: and if foreigners want to know why,
we will tell them that, when there is no law to the contrary, we always
does as we likes with our own.

SECTION III. ON EMPHASIS.
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">E</span>mphasis <span class="pagenum"><a name="link114" id="link114"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p114.jpg">114</a></span>is the distinguishing
of some word or words in a sentence, on which we wish to lay particular
stress, by a stronger and fuller sound, and sometimes by a particular tone
of the voice.
</p>
<p>
A few illustrations of the importance of emphasis will be, perhaps, both
agreeable and useful.
</p>
<p>
When a young lady says to a young gentlemen, "You are a <i>nice</i>
fellow; you <i>are!</i>"&mdash;she means one thing.
</p>
<p>
When a young gentleman, addressing one of his own sex, remarks, "<i>You're</i>
a nice fellow; <i>you</i> are;"&mdash;he means another thing.
</p>
<p>
"Your friend is a gentlemen," pronounced without any particular emphasis,
is the simple assertion of a fact.
</p>
<p>
"Your friend is a gentleman," with the emphasis on the words "friend" and
"gentleman," conveys an insinuation besides.
</p>
<p>
So simple a question as "Do you like pine-apple rum?" is susceptible of as
many meanings as there are words in it; according to the position of the
emphasis.
</p>
<p>
"<i>Do</i> you like pine-apple rum?" is as much as to say, "Do you,
though, really like pine-apple rum?"
</p>
<p>
"Do <i>you</i> like pine-apple rum?" is tantamount to,
</p>
<p>
"Can it be that a young gentleman (or lady) like you, can like pine-apple
rum?"
</p>
<p>
"Do you <i>like</i> pine-apple rum?" means, "Is it possible that instead
of disliking, you are fond of pine-apple rum?"
</p>
<p>
"Do <span class="pagenum"><a name="link115" id="link115"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p115.jpg">115</a></span>you like <i>pine-apple</i>
rum?" is an enquiry as to whether you like that kind of rum in particular.
</p>
<p>
And lastly, "Do you like pine-apple <i>rum?</i>" is equivalent to asking
if you think that the flavor of the pineapple improves that especial form
of alcohol.
</p>
<p>
A well-known instance of an emphasis improperly placed was furnished by a
certain Parson, who read a passage in the Old Testament in the following
unlucky manner: "And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass; and they
saddled <i>him.</i>"
</p>
<p>
Young ladies are usually very emphatic in ordinary discourse. "What a
little <i>dear!</i> Oh! how <i>sweetly</i> pretty! Well! I never <i>did</i>,
I declare! <i>So</i> nice, and <i>so</i> innocent, and <i>so</i>
good-tempered, and <i>so</i> affectionate, and <i>such</i> a color! And <i>oh!
such lovely eyes!</i> and such hair! He <i>was</i> a little duck! he was,
he was, he was. Tzig a tzig, tzig, tzig, tzig, tzig!" &amp;c. &amp;c.
&amp;c.
</p>
<p>
This emphatic way of speaking is indicative of two very amiable feelings
implanted by nature in the female occiput, and called by the Phrenologists
Adhesiveness and Philoprogenitivenes. Those who attempt to imitate it will
be conscious, while forcing out their words, of a peculiar mental motion,
which we cannot explain otherwise than by saying, that it is analogous to
that which attends the act of pressing or squeezing; as when, with the
thumb of the right hand, we knead one lump of putty to another, in the
palm of the left. Perhaps we might also instance, sucking an orange. In
all these cases, the organ of Weight, according to Phrenology, is also
active; and this, perhaps, is one of the faculties which induce young
ladies to lay a stress upon their words. Nevertheless, we fear that a
damsel <span class="pagenum"><a name="link116" id="link116"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p116.jpg">116</a></span>would hardly be pleased
by being told that her weight was considerable, though it would, at the
same time, grievously offend her to accuse her of lightness. Here we need
scarcely observe, that we refer to lightness, not of complexion, but of
sentiment, which is always regarded as a dark shade in the character. This
defect, we think, we may safely assert, will never be observed in emphatic
fair ones.
</p>
<p>
But we have not quite yet exhausted the subject of emphasis, considered in
relation to young ladies. Their letters are as emphatic as their language
is, almost every third word being underlined. Such epistles, inasmuch as
they are addressed to the heart, ought not to be submitted to the ear;
nevertheless we must say that we have occasionally been wicked and waggish
enough to read them aloud&mdash;to ourselves alone, of course. The reader
may, if he choose, follow our example. We subjoin a specimen of female
correspondence, endeared to us by many tender recollections, and admirably
adapted to our present purpose.
</p>

</p>
<p>
I was terribly afraid that Matilda and I would have caught our Death of
cold; but thank Goodness no such untoward event took place. It was very
uncomfortable and I so wished you had been there.. When we got home who do
you think was there? Mr. Sims; and he said he thought that I was so much
grown. Only think. And so then you know we took some refreshment, for I
assure you, what with the journey and altogether we were very nearly
famished; and we were all invited <span class="pagenum"><a name="link117"
id="link117"></a><a href="../44802-page-images/p117.jpg">117</a></span>to
go to the Chubbs' that Evening to a small Teà Party, for which I must own
I thought Mr. Chubb a ism* man. After tea we had a carpet waltz, and
although I was very tired I enjoyed it much. There were some very pretty
girls there, and one or two agreeable young men; but oh! &amp;c.

<p>
The remainder of this letter being of a nature personally interesting to
ourselves only, and likely, in the opinion of some readers, to render its
insertion attributable to motives of vanity, we shall not be found fault
with for objecting to transcribe any more of it.

<h2>
SECTION IV. OF PAUSES.
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> Pause, otherwise called a rest, is an absolute cessation of the voice,
in speaking or reading, during a perceptible interval, longer or shorter,
of time.
</p>
<p>
Comic Pauses often occur in Oratory. "Unaccustomed as I am to public
speaking," is usually followed by a pause of this sort. A young gentleman,
his health having been drunk at a party, afforded, in endeavoring to
return thanks, a signal illustration of the Pause Comic. "Gentlemen," he
began, "the Ancient Romans,"&mdash;(A pause,)&mdash;"gentlemen, the
Ancient Romans,"&mdash;(Hear!)&mdash;"The Ancient Romans, Gentlemen,"&mdash;(Bravo!
hear! hear!)&mdash;"Gentlemen&mdash;that is&mdash;the Ancient Romans"&mdash;"were
very fine fellows, Jack, I dare say," added a friend, pulling the speaker
down by the coat-tail.
</p>
<p>
That notable Ancient Roman, Brutus, is represented by Shakspeare as making
a glorious pause: as "Who's here <span class="pagenum"><a name="link118"
id="link118"></a><a href="../44802-page-images/p118.jpg">118</a></span>so
vile that would not love his country? If any, speak, for him have I
offended. I pause for a reply."

Here of course, Brutus pauses, folds his arms, and looks magnanimous. We

recitation, when he had uttered the words "I pause for a reply," <span
class="pagenum"><a name="link119" id="link119"></a><a

An interesting diversity of tones is exhibited by the popular voice at an
election.

police-magistrate (unless the two characters should chance to be combined,
which sometimes happens, that is, when the latter is a lover of justice)
would say, "Answer me," in very different tones.
</p>
<p>
A lover again would utter the words "For ever and ever," in a very
different tone from that in which a minister would repeat them.
</p>
<p>
A young lady, on her first introduction to you, says, "Sir," in a tone
very unlike that in which she sometime afterwards delivers herself of the
same monosyllable when she is addressing you under the influence of
jealousy.
</p>
<p>
As to the word "Sir," the number of constructions which, according to the
tone in which it is spoken, it may be made to bear, are incalculable. We
may adduce a few instances.
</p>
<p>
"Please, Sir, let me off."
</p>
<p>
"No, Sir!"
</p>
<p>
"Waiter! you, Sir."
</p>
<p>
"Yes, Sir! yes, Sir!"
</p>
<p>
"Sir, I am greatly obliged to you."
</p>
<p>
"Sir, you are quite welcome."
</p>
<p>
"Your servant, Sir" (by a man who brings you a challenge.)
</p>
<p>
"Servant, Sir" (by a tailor bowing you to the door.) "Sir, you are a
gentleman!"

<p>
"Sir, you are a scoundrel!"

CHAPTER II. OF VERSIFICATION.
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t <span class="pagenum"><a name="link121" id="link121"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p121.jpg">121</a></span>is with peculiar
pleasure that we approach this part of Prosody. We belong to a class of
persons to whom a celebrated phrenological manipulator ascribes "some
poetical feeling, if studied or called forth;" and, to borrow another
expression from the same quarter, we sometimes "versify a little;" that is
to say, we versify our literary occupations by an occasional flirtation
with the muses.
</p>
<p>
We have a great respect for the memory of our old schoolmaster;
notwithstanding which, we think we can beat him (which, we shall be told
by the wags, would be tit for tat) at poet-making, though, indeed, he was
a magician in his way. "I'll make thee a poet, my boy," he used to say,
"or the rod shall."
</p>
<p>
Let us try what we can do.
</p>
<p>
A verse consists of a certain number and variety of syllables, put
together and arranged according to certain laws.
</p>
<p>
Verses being also called dulcet strains, harmonious numbers, tuneful lays,
and so forth, it is clear that such combination and arrangement must be so
made as to please the ear.
</p>
<p>
Versification is the making of verses. This seems such a truism as to be
not worth stating; but it is necessary to define what Versification is,
because many people suppose it to be the same thing with poetry. We will
prove that it is not.
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
"Much business in the Funds has lately been
Transacted various monied men between;
Though speculation early in the week
Went slowly; nought was done whereof to speak.
The largest operations, it was found,
Were twenty-five and fifty thousand <i>pound</i>."
</pre>
<p>
We <span class="pagenum"><a name="link122" id="link122"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p122.jpg">122</a></span>might proceed in the
same strain, but we have already done half a dozen lines without a
particle of poetry in them; and we do not wish to overwhelm people with
proofs of what a great many will take upon trust.
</p>
<p>
Every fool knows what Rhyme is; so we need not say anything about that.
</p>
<h3>
ON POETICAL FEET
</h3>
<p>
Poetical feet! Why, Fanny Elsler's feet and Taglioni's feet are poetical
feet&mdash;are they not? or else what is meant by calling dancing the
poetry of Motion? And cannot each of those <i>artistes</i> boast of a toe
which is the very essence of all poetry&mdash;a TO' KAAO'N?
</p>
<p>
No. You may make verses <i>on</i> Taglioni's feet, (though if she be a
poetess, she can do that better than you, standing, too, on one leg, like
the man that Horace speaks of;) but you cannot make them <i>of</i> her
feet. Feet of which verses are composed are made of syllables, not of
bones, muscles, and ligaments. Feet and pauses are the constituent parts
of a verse.
</p>
<p>
We have heard one boy ask of another, who was singing, "How much is that a
yard?" still the yard is not a poetical measure.
</p>
<p>
The feet which are used in poetry consist either of two or three
syllables. There are four kinds of feet of two, and an equal number of
three syllables. Four and four are eight: therefore Pegasus is an octoped;
and if our readers do not understand this logic, we are sorry for it. But
as touching the feet&mdash;we have
</p>
<p>
1. The <span class="pagenum"><a name="link123" id="link123"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p123.jpg">123</a></span>Trochee, which has the
first syllable accent, ed, and the last unaccented: as, "Yànkëe dôodlë."
</p>
<p>
2. The Iambus, which has the first syllable unaccented, and the last
accented: as, "Thé mâid hërsëlf with roûge, àlâs! bëdaübs."
</p>
<p>
3. The Spondee, which has both the words or syllables accented: as, "âll
hâil, grëat king, Tom Thumb, all hail!"
</p>
<p>
4. The Pyrrhic, which has both the words or syllables unaccented: as, "ôn
thë tree'top."
</p>
<p>
5. The Dactyl, which has the first syllable accented and the two latter
unaccented: as, "Jônàthin, Jëffër-sôn."
</p>
<p>
6. The Amphibrach has the first and last syllables unaccented and the
middle one accented: as, "Oë'r-whelmïng, transported, ecstatic,
delightful, àccéptëd, àddrëssës."
</p>
<p>
7. The Anapaest (or as we used to say, <i>Nasty-beast</i>) has the two
first syllables unaccented and the last accented: as, "ôvërgrôwn
grënàdiër."
</p>
<p>
8. The Tribrach has all its syllables unaccented: as, "Matrïmôny,
exquisite nëss."
</p>
<p>
These feet are divided into principal feet, out of which pieces of poetry
may be wholly or chiefly formed; and secondary feet, the use of which is
to diversify the number and improve the verse.
</p>
<p>
We shall now proceed to explain the nature of the principal feet.
</p>
<p>
Iambic verses are of several kinds, each kind consisting of a certain
number of feet or syllables.
</p>
<p>
1. The shortest form of the English Iambic consists of an Iambus, with an
additional short syllable thus coinciding with the Amphibrach: as, <span
class="pagenum"><a name="link124" id="link124"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p124.jpg">124</a></span>
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
"What Sùsàn,
My beauty!
Refuse one
So true t' ye?

This ditty
Of sadness
Begs pity
For madness."
</pre>
<p>
2. The second form of the English Iambic consists of two Iambuses, and
sometimes takes an additional short syllable: as,
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
"My eÿe, whàt fün.
With dog and gun,
And song and shout,
To roam about!
And shoot our snipes!
And smoke our pipes!
Or eat at ease,
Beneath the trees,
Our bread and cheese!
To rouse the hare
From gloomy lair;
To scale the mountain
And ford the fountain,
While rustics wonder
To hear our thunder."
</pre>
<p>
3. The third form consists of three Iambuses: as in the following <i>morceau</i>,
the author of which is, we regret to say, unknown to us; though we did
once hear somebody say that it was Mr. Anon.
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
"Jâck Spràtt éat âll thé fât,
His wife eat all the lean,
And so between them both,
They lick'd the platter clean."
</pre>
<p>
In <span class="pagenum"><a name="link125" id="link125"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p125.jpg">125</a></span>this verse an
additional short syllable is also admitted: as,
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
"Âlëxïs yoüthful ploügh-bôy,
A Shepherdess adored,
Who loved fat Hodge, the cow-boy,
So t'other chap was floored."
</pre>
<p>
4. The fourth form is made up of four Iambuses: as,
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
"Àdieü my boots, cômpàniôns old,
New footed twice, and four times soled;
My footsteps ye have guarded long,
Life's brambles, thorns, and flints among;
And now you're past the cobbler's art,
And fate declares that we must part.
Ah me! what cordial can restore
The gaping patch repatch'd before?
What healing art renew the weal
Of subject so infirm of heel?
What potion, pill, or draught control
So deep an ulcer of the sole?
</pre>
<p>
5. The fifth species of English Iambic consists of five Iambuses: as,
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
You Côme, Tràgïc Müse, ïn tâttèr'd vést ârrày'd,
And while through blood, and mud, and crimes I wade,
Support my steps, and this, my strain, inspire
With Horror's blackest thoughts and bluest fire!"
</pre>
<p>
The Epic of which the above example is the opening, will perhaps appear
hereafter. This kind of Iambic constitutes what is called the heroic
measure:&mdash;of which we shall have more to say by and by; but shall
only <span class="pagenum"><a name="link126" id="link126"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p126.jpg">126</a></span>remark at present that
it, in common with most of the ordinary English measures, is susceptible
of many varieties, by the admission of other feet, as Trochees, Dactyls,
Anapaests, &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
6. Our Iambic in its sixth form, is commonly called the Alexandrine
measure. It consists of six Iambuses: as,
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
"His worship gâve thë word, ànd Snôoks was borne âwày."
</pre>
<p>
The Alexandrine is sometimes introduced into heroic rhyme, and when used,
as the late Mr. John Reeve was wont to say, "with a little moderation,"
occasions an agreeable variety. Thus the example quoted is preceded by the
following lines:&mdash;
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
"What! found at midnight with a darkey, lit,
A bull-dog, jemmy, screw, and centre-bit
And tongueless of his aim? It cannot be
But he was bent, at least, on felony;
He stands remanded. 'Ho! Policeman A!'
His worship gave the word, and Snooks was borne away."
</pre>
<p>
7. The seventh and last form of our Iambic measure is made up of seven
Iambuses. This species of verse has been immortalised by the adoption of
those eminent hands, Messrs. Sternhold and Hopkins. It runs <span
class="pagenum"><a name="link127" id="link127"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p127.jpg">127</a></span>thus:&mdash;
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Goôd pëople âll, I prây dràw nëar, fôr yôu I needs müst têll,
That William Brown is dead and gone; the man you knew full well.
A broad-brimm'd hat, black breeches, and an old Welch wig he wore:
And now and then a long brown coat all button'd up before."
The present measure is as admirably adapted for the
Platform as for the Conventicle.

"My name it is Bill Scroggins, and my fate it is to die,
For I was at the Sessions tried and cast for felony.
My friends, to these my dying words I pray attention lend,
The public-house has brought me unto this untimely end."
</pre>
<p>
Verses of this kind are now usually broken into two lines, with four feet
in the first line, and three in the second: as,
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
"I wish I wëre â little pig
To wallow in the mire,
To eat, and drink, and sleep at ease
Is all that I desire."
</pre>
<p>
Trochaic verse is of several kinds.
</p>
<p>
1. The shortest Trochaic verse in the English language consists of one
Trochee and a long syllable: as,
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
"Billy Black
Got the sack."
</pre>
<p>
Lindley Murray asserts that this measure is defective in dignity, and can
seldom be used on serious occasions. Yet it is Pope who thus sings:
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
"Dreadful screams,
Dismal gleams.
Fires that glow,
Shrieks of woe," &amp;c.
</pre>
<p>
And for our own poor part, let us see what we can make out of a storm.

</p>
<p>
===> See Page Scan
</p>
<p>
2. The second English form of the Trochaic consists of two feet: as,
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
"Vermicelli,
Cürrànt jêlly."
</pre>
<p>
It sometimes contains two feet, or trochees, with an additional long
syllable: as,
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
"Youth inclined tô wed,
Go and shave thy head."
</pre>
<p>
3. The third species consists of three trochees: as,
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
"Sing a song ôf sixpence.
</pre>
<p>
Or of three trochees, with an additional long syllable: as, <span
class="pagenum"><a name="link129" id="link129"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p129.jpg">129</a></span>
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
"Thrice mÿ côat, hâve o'er thée rôll'd,
Summer hot and winter cold,
Since the Snip's creative art
Into being bade thee start;
Now like works the most sublime,
Thou displaty'st the power of time.
Broad grey patches plainly trace,
Right and left each blade-bone's place;
When thy shining collar's scann'd,
Punsters think on classic land:
Thread-bare sleeves thine age proclaim,
Elbows worn announce the same;
Elbows mouldy-black of hue,
Save where white a crack shines through;
While thy parting seams declare
Thou'rt unfit for farther wear&mdash;
Then, farewell! "What! Moses! ho!"
"Clo', Sir? clo', Sir? clo', Sir? clo'?"
</pre>
<p>
4. The fourth Trochaic species consists of four trochees, as:
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
"Ugh! yôu little lümp ôf blübbër,
Sleep, oh! sleep in quiet, do!
Cease awhile your bib to slobber&mdash;
Cease your bottle mouth to screw.

"How I wish your eyelids never
Would unclose again at all;
For I know as soon as ever
You're awake, you're sure to squall.

"Dad and Mammy's darling honey,
Tomb-stone cherub, stuff'd with slops,
Let each noodle, dolt, and spooney
Smack, who will, your pudding chops. <span class="pagenum"><a name="link130"
id="link130"></a><a href="../44802-page-images/p130.jpg">130</a></span>

"As for me, as soon I'd smother,
As I'd drown a sucking cat,
You, you cub, or any other,
Nasty little squalling brat."
</pre>
<p>
"Would you, you disagreeable old Bachelor?"
</p>
<p>

<h4>
<a href="images/139.jpg"><i>Original Size</i></a>
</h4>
<p>
This form may take an additional long syllable, but this measure is very
uncommon. Example:
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
"Chrônônhôtônthôlôgôs the Great,
Godlike in a barrow kept his state."
</pre>
<p>
5. The fifth Trochaic species is likewise uncommon; and, as a Bowbellian
would say, "uncommon" ugly, It contains five trochees: as,
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
"Hëre lies Màrÿ, wife ôf Thômas Càrtër,
Who to typhus fever proved a martyr."
</pre>
<p>
These are a specimen of the "uncouth rhymes" so touchingly alluded to by
Gray.
</p>
<p>
6. The sixth form of the English Trochaic is a line of six trochees: as,
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
"Môst bëwitching damsel, charming Aràbéllâ,
Prithee, cast an eye of pity on a fellow."
</pre>
<p>
The Dactylic measure is extremely uncommon. The following <span
class="pagenum"><a name="link131" id="link131"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p131.jpg">131</a></span>may be considered an
example of one species of it:
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
"Cëlià thé crüël, resolv'd nôt tô mârry sôon,
Boasts of a heart like a fortified garrison,
Bulwarks and battlements keeping the <i>beaux</i> all off,
Shot from within knocking lovers like foes all off."
</pre>
<p>
Anapaestic verses are of various kinds.
</p>
<p>
1. The shortest anapæstic verse is a single anapaest:
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
"In thë glass
There's an ass."
</pre>
<p>
This measure, after all, is ambiguous; for if the stress of the voice be
laid on the first and third syllables, it becomes trochaic. Perhaps,
therefore, it is best to consider the first form of our Anapæstic verse,
as made up of two anapaests: as,
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
"Sët â schôolbôy ât wôrk
With a knife and a fork."
</pre>
<p>
And here if you like, you may have another short syllable: as,
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
"And hôw sôon thë yoüng glüttôn
Will astonish your mutton!"
</pre>
<p>
2. The second species consists of three anapaests: as,
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
"Amàrÿllïs was slëndër ànd tail,
Colin Clodpole was dumpy and fat;
And tho' she did'n't like him at all,
Yet he doted on her for all that."
</pre>
<p>
This metre is sometimes denominated sing-song.
</p>
<p>
3. The third kind of English Anapæstics may be very well exemplified by an
Irish song:
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
"Hâve yôu e'er hàd thë lück tô sëe Dônnÿbrôok Fair?"
</pre>
<p>
It <span class="pagenum"><a name="link132" id="link132"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p132.jpg">132</a></span>consists, as will have
been observed, of four ana-pæsts. Sometimes it admits of a short syllable
at the end of the verse: as,
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
In the dëad ôf thë night, when with dire càtërwàuling
Of grimalkins in chorus the house-tops resound:
All insensibly drunk, and unconsciously sprawling
In the kennel, how pleasant it is to be found!"
</pre>
<p>
The various specimens of versification of which examples have been given,
may be improved and varied by the admission of secondary feet into their
composition; but as we are not writing an Art of Poetry, we cannot afford
to show how: particularly as the only way, after all, of acquiring a real
knowledge of the structure of English verse, is by extensive reading.
Besides, there yet remain a few Directions for Poetical Beginners, which
we feel ourselves called upon to give, and for which, if we do not take
care, we shall not have room.
</p>
<p>
The commencement of a poet's career is usually the writing of <i>nonsense</i>
verses. The nonsense of these compositions is very often unintentional;
but sometimes words are put together avowedly without regard to sense, and
with no other view than that of acquiring a familiarity with metrical
arrangement: as,
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
"Approach, disdain, involuntary, tell."
</pre>
<p>
But this is dry work. It may be necessary to compose in this way just at
first, but in our opinion, there is a good and a bad taste to be displayed
even in writing nonsense verses; that is, verses which really deserve that
name. We recommend the young poet to make it his aim to render his
nonsense as perfect as&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
It <span class="pagenum"><a name="link133" id="link133"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p133.jpg">133</a></span>were manifestly
culpable to make no mention, in a work of this sort, of certain measures
which are especially and essentially, of a comic nature. Some of these
have been already adverted to, but two principal varieties yet remain to
be considered.
</p>
<p>
1. Measures taken from the Latin, in which the structure of the ancient
verse, as far as the number and arrangement of the feet are concerned, is
preserved, but the quantity of which is regulated in accordance with the
spirit of our own language. The character of such verses will be best
displayed by employing them on sentimental or serious subjects. Take, for
example, Long and Short, or Hexameter and Pentameter verses.
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
"Jülïà, girl ôf my heart, ïs thàn jëssâmïne swëetër, ôr frësh mëads
Hày-côvër'd; whât rôse tints thôse ôn hër chëeks, thàt flôurish,
Approach? those bright eyes, what stars, what glittering dew-drops?
And oh! what Parian marble, or snow, that bosom?
If she my love return, what bliss will be greater than mine; but
What more deep sadness if she reprove my passion?
Either a bridegroom proud yon ivy-clad church shall receive me
Soon; or the cold church-yard me with its turf shall cover."
</pre>
<p>
Or the Sapphic metre of which the late Mr. Canning's "Knife-Grinder" is so
brilliant an example. Sappho, fair reader, was a poetess, who made
love-verses which could be actually scanned. History relates <span
class="pagenum"><a name="link134" id="link134"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p134.jpg">134</a></span>that, for the sake of
some unprincipled or unfeeling fellow, she committed <i>felo de se</i>.
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
"I can endüre this crüël pain nô lôngër;
Fare ye well, blue skies, rivers, fields, and song-birds!'
Thus the youth spoke; and adding,
'Oh, Jemima!' Plunged in the billow!"

<h4>
<a href="images/143.jpg"><i>Original Size</i></a>
</h4>
<p>
2. Measures reducible to no rule, or Doggrel. Sternhold and Hopkins were
illustrious as Doggrel writers.
</p>
<p>
Doggrel <span class="pagenum"><a name="link135" id="link135"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p135.jpg">135</a></span>is commonly used by
anonymous poets for the purpose of embodying the moral reflections which a
homicide or an execution excites in the sensitive mind. May we hope that
our remarks on Prosody will in some little degree tend to facilitate,
perhaps to improve, the future treatment of those two deeply interesting
subjects&mdash;Love and Murder?

CHAPTER III. PUNCTUATION.
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>ind <span class="pagenum"><a name="link136" id="link136"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p136.jpg">136</a></span>your stops." This is
one of the earliest maxims inculcated by the instructors of youth. Hence
it is clear that the subject of Punctuation is an important one: but
inasmuch as the reader, who has arrived at the present page, has either
not understood a word that he has been reading, or else knows as much
about the matter as we can tell him, we fear that a long dissertation
concerning periods, commas, and so on, would only serve to embarrass his
progress in learning with useless stops. We shall, therefore, confine
ourselves to that notice of Punctuation, and that only, which the peculiar
nature of our work may require.
</p>
<p>
First, it may be remarked, that the notes of admiration which we so often
hear in theatres, may be called notes of hand. Secondly, that notes of
interrogation are not at all like bank notes; although they are largely
uttered in Banco Regino. Let us now proceed with our subject.
</p>
<p>
Punctuation is the soul of Grammar, as Punctuality is that of business.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps somebody or other may take advantage of what we have said, to
prove both Punctuation and Punctuality immaterial. No matter.
</p>
<p>
It <span class="pagenum"><a name="link137" id="link137"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p137.jpg">137</a></span>is both absurd and
inconvenient to stand upon points.

<p>
Of how much consequence, however, Punctuation is, the student may form
some idea, by considering the different effects which a piece of poetry,
for instance, which he has been accustomed to regard as sublime or
beautiful, will have, when liberties are taken with it in that respect.
</p>
<p>
Imagine an actor commencing Hamlet's famous soliloquy, thus:
</p>
<p>
"To be; or not to be that is. The question," &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
Or <span class="pagenum"><a name="link138" id="link138"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p138.jpg">138</a></span>saying, in the person
of Duncan, in Macbeth:
</p>
<p>
"This castle hath a pleasant seat, the air."
</p>
<p>
Or as the usurper himself, exclaiming,
</p>
<p>
"The devil damn thee black, thou cream-faced loon!
</p>
<p>
Where got'st thou that goose? Look!"

<p>
We <span class="pagenum"><a name="link139" id="link139"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p139.jpg">139</a></span>have now said as much
as we think it necessary to say on the head of English Grammar. We shall
conclude our labors with an "Address to Young Students and as to the
question, what that has to do with our subject, we shall leave it to be
settled by Lindley Murray, whose example, in this respect, we follow. All
we shall observe is, that in our opinion, advice concerning manners stand
in the same relation to a Comic English Grammar, as instruction in morals
does to a Serious one. For the remarks which it will now be our business
to make, we bespeak the indulgence of our elder readers, and the attention
of such as are of tender age.

<h2>
ADDRESS TO YOUNG STUDENTS.
</h2>
<h3>
Young Gentlemen,
</h3>
<p>
Having attentively perused the foregoing pages, you will be desirous, it
is to be presumed, of carrying still farther those comical pursuits in
which, with both pleasure and profit to yourselves, you have been lately
engaged. Should such be your laudable intention, you will learn, with
feelings of lively satisfaction, that it is one, in the accomplishment of
which, thanks to Modern Taste, you will find encouragement at every step.
The literature of the day is professedly comic, and of the few works which
are not made ludicrous by the design of their authors, the majority are
rendered so in spite <span class="pagenum"><a name="link140" id="link140"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p140.jpg">140</a></span>of it. In the course of
your reading, however, you will be frequently brought into contact with
hack-ney-coachmen, cabmen, lackeys, turnkeys, thieves, lawyers' clerks,
medical students, and other people of that description, who are all very
amusing when properly viewed, as the monkeys and such like animals at the
Zoological Gardens are, when you look at them through the bars of their
cage. But too great familiarity with persons of this class is sure to
breed contempt, not for them and their manners, but for the usages and
modes of expression adopted in parlors and drawingrooms, that is to say,
in good society. Nay, it is very likely to cause those who indulge in it
to learn various tricks and eccentricities, both of behavior and speech,
for "It is certain, that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is
caught, as men take diseases, one of another." Shakspere.
</p>
<p>
Beset thus, as you will necessarily be, by perils and dangers in your
wanderings amid the fields of Comicality, you will derive great advantage
from knowing be-fore-hand what you are likely to meet with, and what it
will be incumbent on you to avoid. It is to furnish you with this
information that the following hints and instructions are intended.
</p>
<p>
Be careful, when you hear yourself called by name, to reply "Here I am,"
and not "Here you are," an error into which you are very likely to be led
by the perusal of existing authors.
</p>
<p>
When you partake, if it be your habit to do so, of the beverage called
porter, drink it as you would water, or any other liquid. Do not wink your
eye, or nod sideways to your companion; such actions, especially when
preceded by blowing away the foam which col lects <span class="pagenum"><a
name="link141" id="link141"></a><a href="../44802-page-images/p141.jpg">141</a></span>on
the top of the vessel, being exceedingly inelegant: in order that you may
not be incommoded by this foam or froth, always pour the fluid gently into
a tumbler, instead of drinking it out of the metallic tankard in which it
is usually brought to you.
</p>
<p>
In asking for malt liquor generally, never request the waiter to "draw it
mild and do not, on any occasion, be guilty of using the same phrase in a
metaphorical sense, that is to say, as a substitute for "Do it quietly,"
</p>
<p>
"Be gentle," and the like.
</p>
<p>
Never exhort young ladies, during a quadrille, to "fake away," or to
"flare up," for they, being unacquainted with the meaning of such terms,
will naturally conclude that it is an improper one.
</p>
<p>
Avoid inquiries after the health of another person's mother, using that
word synonymously with Mamma, to denote a female parent. Though you may be
really innocent of any intention to be rude, your motives may very
possibly be misconstrued. Remember also on no account to put questions,
either to friends or strangers, respecting the quantity of soap in their
possession.
</p>
<p>
Should it be necessary for you to speak of some one smoking tobacco, do
not call that substance a weed, or the act of using it "blowing a cloud."
</p>
<p>
When an acquaintance pays you a visit, take care, in rising to receive
him, not to appear to be washing your hands, and, should you be engaged in
writing at the time, place your pen on the table, or in the inkstand, and
not behind your ear.
</p>
<p>
Observe, when your tailor comes to measure you, the way in which he wears
his hair, and should your own <span class="pagenum"><a name="link142"
id="link142"></a><a href="../44802-page-images/p142.jpg">142</a></span>style
in this particular unfortunate resemble his, be sure to alter it
immediately.
</p>
<p>
Never dance <i>â la cuisinière</i>, that is to say, do not cut capers.
</p>
<p>
Eschew large shirt pins.
</p>
<p>
Never say "Ma'am" or "Miss," in addressing a young lady, if you cannot
contrive to speak to her without doing so, say nothing.
</p>
<p>
Never, under any circumstances, let the abbreviation "gent." for
gentleman, escape the enclosure of your teeth. Above all things, for the
sake of whatever you hold most dear, never say "me and another gent."
</p>
<p>
When you receive a coin of any kind, deposit it at once in your pocket,
without the needless preliminary of furling it in the air.
</p>
<p>
Never ask a gentleman how much he has a-year.
</p>
<p>
In speaking of a person of your own age, or of an elderly gentleman, do
not say, Old So-and-so, but So-and-so, or Mr. So-and-so, as the case may
be: and have no nicknames for each other. We were much horrified not long
since, by hearing a great coarse fellow, in a leathern hat and fustian
jacket, exclaim, turning round to his companion, "Now, then, come along,
old Blokey!"
</p>
<p>
When you have got a cold in the head and weak eyes, do not go and call on
young ladies.
</p>
<p>
Do not eat gravy with a knife, for fear those about you should suppose you
to be going to commit suicide.
</p>
<p>
In offering to help a person at dinner, do not say, "Allow me to <i>assist</i>
you." When you ask people what wine they will take, never say, "What'll
you have?" or, "What'll you <i>do it in?</i>"
</p>
<p>
If <span class="pagenum"><a name="link143" id="link143"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p143.jpg">143</a></span>you are talking to a
clergyman about another member of the clerical profession, adopt some
other method of describing his avocation than that of saying, "I believe
he is in your line."
</p>
<p>
Do not recommend an omelet to a lady, as a good <i>article</i>.
</p>
<p>
Be cautious not to use the initial letter of a person's surname, in
mentioning or in addressing him. For instance, never think of saying,
"Mrs. Hobbs, pray, how is Mr. H.?"
</p>
<p>
Call all articles of dress by their proper names. What delight can be
found by a thinking mind in designating a hat as a tile, trousers,
kickseys, a neckerchief, a fogle, or a choker; or a great coat, an upper
Benjamin? And never speak of clothes, collectively, as toggs or toggery.
</p>

We here approach the conclusion of our labors. Young gentlemen, once more
it is earnestly requested that you will give your careful attention to the
rules and admonitions which have been above laid down for your guidance.
We might have given a great many more; but we hope that the spirit of our
instructions will enable the diligent youth to supply, by observation and
reflection, that which, for obvious reasons, we have necessarily left
unsaid. And now we bid you farewell. That you may never have the
misfortune of entering, with splashed boots, a drawing-room full of
ladies; that you may never, having been engaged in a brawl on the previous
evening, meet, with a black eye, the object of your affections the next
morning; that you may never, in a moment of agitation, omit the aspirate,
or use it when you ought not; that your laundress may always <span
class="pagenum"><a name="link144" id="link144"></a><a
href="../44802-page-images/p144.jpg">144</a></span>do justice to your
linen; and your tailor make your clothes well, and send them home in due
time; that your braces may never give way during a waltz; that you may
never, sitting in a strong light at a large dinner-party, suddenly
remember that you have not shaved for two days; that your hands and face
may ever be free from tan, chaps, freckles, pimples, brandy-blossoms, and
all other disfigurements; that you may never be either inelegantly fat, or
ridiculously lean; and finally, that you may always have plenty to eat,
plenty to drink, and plenty to laugh at, we earnestly and sincerely wish.
And should your lot in life be other than fortunate, we can only say, that
we advise you to bear it with patience; to cultivate Comic Philosophy; and
to look upon your troubles as a joke.
